This one is so sub par that I really do not understand why it is still on the market. It is truly a weird and dated formula that probably worked OK 20+ years ago, but does not really compare to today's foundations, even from a drug store. It has a weird texture that kind of rolls throughout the day in a weird way. It is supposed to be moisturizing or oil controlling depending on the area of the face, well for me, it does neither. I suppose Clinique is still making it because people are buying it. If you are a fan of it for some reason I would strongly encourage you to try Even Better foundation instead!"

Unfortunately, the reformulation includes lavender oil, which prevents us from giving this foundation a higher rating.Although lavender oil is often touted for its calming properties (and indeed, inhaling the scent can be therapeutic), as a skin-care ingredient it's a problem. Even small amounts of lavender oil (0.25% or less) can be problematic because lavender leaves contain camphor, a known skin irritant. Because the fragrance constituents in lavender oil oxidize when exposed to air, lavender oil is a pro-oxidant. This enhanced oxidation also increases its irritancy on the skin (Source: Contact Dermatitis, September 2008, pages 143–150).If lavender oil weren't such a problematic ingredient, we'd rate this foundation better based on its fabulously lightweight yet moisturizing texture that blends easily and sets to an attractive, dewy finish. Although the shades do tend to run slightly warm (yellow to golden peach and copper), there are still workable options for very light to deep skin tones.			
			
							
					Pros:
					
													Lightweight texture.
													Hydrating formula for dry skin.
													Attractive dewy finish.
													Workable shades for very light to deep skin tones.
											
				
			
							
					Cons:
					
													Includes lavender oil, which is very problematic for skin.
													Entire shade range is warmer than what Brown's foundations typically offer.","Luminous Moisturizing Treatment Foundation","Bobbi Brown","",""

This foundation is buildable for light-to-full coverage, depending on your preference. It seems to have enough pigment so that you really don't have to use a lot, which is good because if you use a heavy hand, it does have a tendency to cake.

I don't know if there were any formula changes) for a couple of years now.  I use P1 as P2 is too dark.  Makeup consultants will claim I am an N, but the N is too yellow.  W is very yellow, N is mildly yellow with no pink, and P is all pink.  I am a true cool summer who cannot wear neutral tones.  My skin is dry to very dry and very sensitive.  I can only wear zinc oxide because I am allergic to chemical sunscreens.  Titanium dioxide triggers cystic acne that take weeks to heal.  I have controlled rosacea and this foundation does not trigger it.  I prefer foundations without sunscreen so I can control what I put on my skin.  I prefer liquid foundations that stay liquid.  I do not like liquid-to-powder because it makes my dry skin feel even drier.  This is not a full coverage makeup.  I would call it medium and it doesn't matter if I apply with a sponge or a foundation brush.  It really does stay for a long time.  More than 8 hours.  In fact, I find I have to use makeup remover wipes (I use Lumene) with Paula's Choice Gentle Makeup Remover to remove this sticky glue from my skin.  At the end of the day, my skin feels parched and this is after a generous application of CeraVe cream before putting on makeup.  I feel stuck because P1 is the perfect color but the formula is not friendly for my skin.  If your skin is dry before you apply the foundation, it will not blend well.  In fact, the foundation is so drying that it kind of rolls over itself."

I've been a fan ever since!  I use the Light Tan shade and I've been very satisfied with the color, appearance, texture, natural look, ease of use and all-over-face coverage. One thing I do that helps with applying any brand of powder foundation, is applying a good primer first.  I agree with the expert review that PUR doesn't work well as a concealer, but that's a minor issue for me. 

I switched from BareMinerals and here are my reasons:
I was using BareMinerals powders for over 5 years because I prefer a natural no-makeup look and it worked great for that purpose. Liquid foundations are either too greasy, dewy or sticky after applying to the oily parts of my face. The main issue I've always had with BareMinerals powder is that it takes too many steps to apply (i.e. pour foundation powder into lid, swirl brush, tap to remove excess; then repeat with Mineral Veil).  I tried the BareMinerals Ready pressed powder and it's messy - as you're swirling the powder, powder flies all over the place."

The main issue is that the formula isn't easy to blend. It quickly grabs to any moist areas of skin, and that affects how the color looks. The result is uneven, with the slightly moist areas getting moderate coverage and the drier areas getting sheer, spotty coverage. This finishes to a satiny glow, but still feels dry. Those with dry skin or dry areas will feel their skin getting progressively drier after several hours of wear, while those with oily skin will likely find it pools in large pores and looks blotchy. No mineral makeup is worth this much compromise.

A pleasant surprise!","This is a long review but well worth it! This is like a cross between Kevyn Aucoin's Sensual Skin Enhancer and Josie Maran Vibrancy Argan Foundation. I have very dry skin, often have dry patches, and I have very pale olive skin that is hard to match, sensitive and irritates easily and can break out with many producta- so needless to say it is hard to find foundations. This though works great! I use tge shade Shell (similar to Nars Gobi in color and Josie Maran Vibrancy G15 Cosmic). Instead of sucking the moisture out of my skin like most mattifying products, it actually held my natural moisture in while keeping my skin from looking/feeling a hot mess in this tropical rainforest like god awful humidity! It was a huge surprise that it did NOT cling to my dry patches, but instead smoothed them out! The coverage is in between the two - very close to completely full coverage but without being heavy- easy to make it totally full. The texture is much like JM- it feels very whipped, like a dense mousse. It dries very quickly like the description says- use your fingers or a large stippling or buffing brush. Normally I use my beauty blender for everything as i love how flawless and natural the finish is, but do not try it with this, and you don't need to use a BB with this anyway. The finish was very natural looking and feeling but I looked flawless! Even the hubs (a manly man mechanic) commented how flawless my skin looked! The only other products he has noticed and commented the positive difference on are Guerlain- so that should really tell you something about this product! This worked beautifully over all my primers, but i feel that any glow/light focused pre-foundation products get lost with this over it, because of it's very strong coverage. Even my HG ambient primer I felt got lost with this over it. So imo, save the glow products for post foundation application. Guerlain Meteorites pearls and pressed conpacts, and HG Ambient and Strobe powders are gorgeous over this."

Consider this further proof that a designer pedigree and matching price tag do not necessarily equate to a high-quality makeup product!Velvet Foundation is a medium-coverage liquid that's a bit difficult to blend, as it tends to drag as you apply it. Once blended, it does a good job of covering up imperfections, and it sets to an attractive velvet finish as advertised. It's also long-lasting as claimed, and doesn't fade throughout the day. All of that sounds good, but things go downhill quickly from here.Even though this foundation doesn't fade, it does start to emphasize wrinkles the longer you wear it, and it tends to ""bunch up"" in areas around the corners of the eyes and the nose. It also has a strong, almost baby powder–like scent when applied, and the scent lingers for about 30 minutes after you've put it on. That's really unusual because most liquid foundations omit fragrance or, if it's part of the formula, it's subtle.This foundation comes in a variety of shades for most skin tones, but avoid the too-pink Trench 202. Velvet Foundation certainly isn't an all-out bust, but it's not worth the hefty price, especially when you can find better and less expensive options on our list of Best Foundations Without Sunscreen.			
			
							
					Pros:
					
													Does a good job of providing medium coverage for imperfections.
													Dries to an attractive velvet finish.
													Long-lasting as claimed.
											
				
			
							
					Cons:
					
													Difficult to blend when applying.
													Emphasizes wrinkles, and bunches up in fine lines around the eyes and nose.
													Has a strong, baby powderlike scent that lingers for about 30 minutes after it's applied, and that much fragrance can be irritating for the skin.
											
				
			
							
More Info:
Daily use of products that contain a high amount of fragrance, whether the fragrant ingredients are synthetic or natural, causes chronic irritation that can damage healthy collagen production, lead to or worsen dryness, and impair your skin's ability to heal. Fragrance-free is the best way to go for all skin types. If fragrance in your skin-care products is important to you, it should be a very low amount to minimize the risk to your skin (Sources: Inflammation Research, December 2008, pages 558–563; Skin Pharmacology and Physiology, June 2008, pages 124–135, and November-December 2000, pages 358–371; Journal of Investigative Dermatology, April 2008, pages 15–19; Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology, March 2008, pages 78–82; Mechanisms of Ageing and Development, January 2007, pages 92–105; and British Journal of Dermatology, December 2005, pages S13–S22).","Velvet Foundation","Burberry Beauty","",""

Every time I tried to build it up, it seemed like I would remove the layers that came before. Once applied, this felt slippery and greasy on the skin. I powdered it hoping it would stay in place, and I was about to leave my home when I caught a glimpse of myself in the hallway mirror.

The thick texture smears onto the skin rather than blending evenly, and given the inclusion of a fair amount of beeswax, the texture feels too heavy for oily or breakout-prone skin.

The original ColorStay for Combination/Oily had sunscreen, but that's been removed, and the new version doesn't hold back shine, which is really disappointing. This certainly isn't a terrible foundation by any means, but it's not as impressive as some of the other foundations you can find right next to it on the shelf of your local drugstore.
This foundation is easier to blend than its Normal/Dry counterpart, and provides good medium coverage for blemishes and redness. It dries to a soft matte finish and does indeed last all day, but ignore the 24-hour claim because you should never leave your foundation on overnight!
ColorStay, true to most Revlon foundations, comes in a variety of attractive shades, from very fair to very dark, and most are wearable for their intended skin tones.
Unfortunately, as this makeup wears, it begins to emphasize expression lines and wrinkles, leading to significant creasing about three hours post-application. That quality is essentially an aging effect, which is definitely not attractive! Also note that this formula differs very little from its Normal/Dry counterpart, except that this one contains a small amount of alcohol and more orchid extract, a fragrance ingredient. Ideally, the Normal/Dry version should be markedly different from this version for Combination/Oily skin, given that normal to dry skin has needs that are very different from the needs of combination to oily skin.
			
			
							
					Pros:
					
													Provides good medium coverage for blemishes and redness.
													Lasts several hours before fading.
													Comes in a wide variety of shades for many skin tones.
											
				
			
							
					Cons:
					
													Emphasizes expression lines and wrinkles, leading to creasing as the day wears on.
													Doesn't hold back shine.
													This version does not have sunscreen.

This spray-on foundation is a mess. Sephora suggests covering your hair and your clothes, but that won't save your eyebrows, eyelashes, lips, or ears from getting coated as you apply.It's possible to spray this product onto a brush and then apply, but it's hardly worth the bother when there are other less-gimmicky foundations that can get the job done better (and faster).If you're willing to put up with the messy, prep-required application process, this long-wearing foundation's positives are that it blends well and offers medium to full coverage. But we're back to bad news with the shades: The selection is limited, and unattractive—tending toward being too yellow or too orange. You may find a workable shade, but again, there are better foundations that are much easier to apply.

The fluid texture is on the runny side, and demands vigorous shaking before each use or you will notice separation and have trouble getting this to blend on evenly. Once shaken well, you dispense it from a fine-point tip and blend… and keep blending because this has quite a bit of slip and takes longer than usual to set. The finish is matte with a subtle sheen and provides translucent to sheer coverage that won’t exaggerate large pores or wrinkles. This foundation’s best attribute is how natural it looks, yet the tradeoff is minimal coverage. This isn’t the makeup to choose if you have an uneven skin tone, brown spots, or redness you’d like to soften. It helps to some extent, but really you’re getting less coverage than most tinted moisturizers provide. For some, that may be just perfect.The formula is best for normal to oily or combination skin. It does not provide enough moisture for dry areas, though you can prep with an emollient moisturizer (with sunscreen, because this foundation doesn’t offer sun protection) first.As for the shades, there are great options for light to dark skin tones, with none to avoid. However, many of the shades go on a bit pink or peach, so you’ll need to choose carefully. The pink and peach tones aren’t worth avoiding because the overall effect from this makeup is so sheer. There are no colors for very light skin but the darker shades are outstanding.","Invisible Fluid Makeup","Estee Lauder","",""

The finish is on the satin-matte side, as it lends a soft sheen to skin—this “sheen” doesn’t show up on skin as noticeable glitter, but it may not be a desirable look for those with oily or very oily skin. The “adjustable” part of the name stems from the fact that Mally Beauty claims you can use this wet or dry, depending on how much coverage you want. Used dry and applied with a powder brush, you’ll find it provides sheer to light coverage—ideal for those who want a natural look, but it won’t hide most imperfections (plan on using this foundation with a concealer if you want to fully conceal red marks or other types of discoloration).As is the case with many powder foundations, using the included sponge applicator often results in a cakey, or heavy look—we would recommend skipping the sponge in favor of a brush for a better result. Unfortunately, where Visible Skin falls short is when it’s applied wet. When applied in this manner, either with a brush or sponge, it tends to dry to an uneven, streaky finish on skin. The color range consists of five neutral, skin realistic tones ranging from light to deep.  The shades run slightly darker than you would expect, so we would recommend trying this on in-store (sold at ULTA) if at all possible to find the best match for your skin tone. The verdict? Visible Skin Adjustable Coverage Foundation is a good, albeit pricey, option for those seeking a minimal coverage (and a satin-matte finish) powder foundation. Those in need of buildable, medium to full coverage and/or classic matte finish should consider other alternatives on our Best Powder Foundations list instead Pros:
Dry, absorbent finish is ideal for normal to oily skin. 
Provides sheer to light coverage. 
Flattering shades for light to deep skin tones.
 Cons:
When applied wet (as suggested), it can look uneven.","Visible Skin Adjustable Coverage Foundation","Mally Beauty","",""

This is not the foundation to pick if you want sheer to light coverage, though we suppose you could mix this with a moisturizer to sheer the results. It finish is absorbent, long-wearing, and noticeably matte—any dry areas will be magnified, so be sure to moisturize those spots first. Ideally, this foundation is tailor-made for skin that’s oily to very oily all over, as those skin types are most likely to be thrilled with how this looks and wears. It does a formidable job keeping excess shine in check, though you may find you need to blot or powder at some point during your day.The range of shades is extensive, impressive, and mostly warm-toned, so you’ll see more yellow to gold tones than pink or rosy tones. The only shade to avoid is Deep Neutral which is strongly peach. Honey is slightly peach but workable, as is Creamwhip. The darkest shades (Spice, Clove, and Amber) are good for dark skin tones though they’re quite similar. The shade options for very fair skin are limited, but still worth a look.

When I told her it was Almay she was shocked! I think that is a big enough of a complement to the foundation already but I love this foundation! The color is great for me (buff). I feel like my skin looks natural and never caked which is especially important considering I have acne. It doesn't cover EVERY dark spot or blemish however I have grown to love the natural look, instead of looking like I have a full face of makeup. It wears well, do need to apply powder midday, but that's it! Easiest to blend with a brush! Wearing a primer also helps extend wear. Overall love!"

While there is definitely some airbrushing magic going on there (it's true of all makeup ads), you can still expect this cream-to-powder foundation to deliver on its promise of beautiful coverage that doesn't look ""made up""!Long-Wear Even Finish Compact Foundation is a creamy formula housed in a compact that comes with an applicator sponge. The sponge works just fine, but you can also use a foundation brush, or even your fingers, to apply this. It blends quickly and easily and provides excellent medium coverage with a natural-looking soft matte finish.This doesn't feel the slightest bit heavy; in fact, you might forget you're wearing makeup—and it lasts for several hours without fading. Bobbi Brown claims this can hold up for as long as 12 hours, although we didn't wear it quite that long.This formula would work for most skin types because it's creamy enough to be moisturizing but not so emollient that it will cause problems for oily skin; however, if your skin is oily, it's best to use this together with powder, as some oiliness can become apparent after about four hours of wear. Note that the ingredients that keep this foundation in cream form aren't the best for use over breakout-prone skin.As with most Bobbi Brown foundations, this comes in a great variety of shades, from very light to very dark, and they look natural on their intended skin tones. Even better, this is fragrance-free. All around, this is a great addition to Bobbi Brown's makeup stable!

While most mineral makeup comes in either loose- or pressed-powder form, The Body Shop took a different approach with this foundation. This lightweight, fragrance-free liquid foundation provides normal to dry skin with light to medium coverage. It also blends far better than The Body Shop’s cream compact version of this foundation. While the texture is silky-soft, allowing for easy application with your fingertips, a brush, or a sponge, the finish is definitely dewy, so you’ll want to experiment to see if it will work well for your skin type. If wrinkles are an issue, be advised that this did settle slightly into lines around the eyes.
Among the many shades there are options for fair to dark skin tones, though you’d do best to avoid Rose Beige and Golden Vanilla because, despite their names, they have ashy undertones that can make the complexion look grayish. As for the mineral makeup angle, please see More Info below to learn why it’s more marketing angle than a beauty breakthrough. Also refer to More Info for what is a confusing discrepancy regarding the claim that this foundation provides sun protection.
Note that this contains fragrance in the form of ethylene brassylate.
Pros:

Lightweight liquid texture applies and blends easily.
Provides light coverage that can be built up if needed.
Sets to a dewy finish.

Cons:

It's the first foundation for light skin I've been able to find that isn't too peachy toned or too pink. It's truly a neutral dk beige that delivers beautiful looking skin. And it stays that color all day. Most foundations turn peachy (oxidize) on me after only ~30 mins, no matter how pricey they are. Like others below, I regularly get compliments on my skin when I wear this.

For comparison, IT's CC foundation starts the same great color but doesn't stay that way on me. It turns peach like everything else. It's also far more visible even before it turns. It doesn't blend in like this one does. The texture of this O2 foundation is second to none in looking like it's just your own glowing skin.

Sheer Compact Foundation is a pressed powder with a very silky feel that isn't overly powdery. This applies nicely, melding into the skin with minimal effort for a natural, semi-matte finish that never looks cakey.Sheer compact foundation wears well throughout the day and does a good job of keeping oil at bay, although if your skin is particularly oily, you will need to carry this powder around for touch-ups after about four or five hours of wear. This foundation doesn't emphasize fine lines or wrinkles—a definite bonus, especially for a powder!The only drawback is that, like many other Burberry products, this foundation includes fragrance. The fragrance doesn't linger, but it definitely is noticeable when you first apply it—a definite minus given that this amount of fragrance can be irritating for skin (see More Info for details).			
			
							
					Pros:
					
													Foundation feels silky and melds easily into the skin.
													Natural, semi-matte, medium coverage that doesn't look cakey.
													Does a good job of controlling oil for several hours.
													Doesn't emphasize fine lines or wrinkles.
											
				
			
							
					Cons:
					
													Contains fragrance that is noticeable when you first apply it, and that much fragrance can be irritating for the skin.
											
				
			
							
More Info:
Daily use of products that contain a high amount of fragrance, whether the fragrant ingredients are synthetic or natural, causes chronic irritation that can damage healthy collagen production, lead to or worsen dryness, and impair your skin's ability to heal. Fragrance-free is the best way to go for all skin types. If fragrance in your skin-care products is important to you, it should be a very low amount to minimize the risk to your skin (Sources: Inflammation Research, December 2008, pages 558–563; Skin Pharmacology and Physiology, June 2008, pages 124–135, and November-December 2000, pages 358–371; Journal of Investigative Dermatology, April 2008, pages 15–19; Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology, March 2008, pages 78–82; Mechanisms of Ageing and Development, January 2007, pages 92–105; and British Journal of Dermatology, December 2005, pages S13–S22).","Sheer Compact Foundation","Burberry Beauty","",""

Coverage can go from sheer to medium, and this foundation layers well for additional coverage without a heavy or caked appearance. The nonaqueous silicone formula’s main drawback is that it exaggerates any degree of dry skin. Therefore, either exfoliate your skin before using it or make sure your skin is prepped by applying a moisturizing sunscreen. Of course, applying a moisturizer negates this matte makeup’s benefit for oily skin, but someone with very oily skin (who is unlikely to have any dry patches) can skip this step. Of the shades available, there are options for light and dark (but not very dark) skin tones. The only shades to steer clear of due to strong overtones of pink or peach are Creamy Natural, Pure Beige, Medium Beige, and Tan. Porcelain Ivory is a good shade for fair skin tones, while Cocoa is a deep brown shade that doesn’t turn ashy on skin, always a plus! Classic Ivory may be too peach for some light skin tones.","Dream Matte Mousse Foundation","Maybelline New York","",""

It swipes on smoothly right from the stick, and what is most surprising is that when you blend this in, you'll notice it meshes with skin very well for light to medium coverage that looks remarkably natural.This foundation has a soft satin finish that wears well throughout the day – and best of all, doesn't emphasize pores, wrinkles or fine lines.

While it does contain some fragrance, which is not the best for skin, the amount present shouldn't be a problem, though the best foundations leave this out of their formulas.Note: Stick foundations aren't the best for breakout-prone skin because the ingredients that keep this type of foundation in stick form tend to clog pores.

The color I picked (10 watts) was a good match, but that's where the positive things end. This foundation's coverage is so sheer that it's almost nonexistent. I generally prefer a light to medium coverage buildable foundation, but I had to add layer after layer of this in some areas. Every time I tried to build it up, it seemed like I would remove the layers that came before. Once applied, this felt slippery and greasy on the skin. I powdered it hoping it would stay in place, and I was about to leave my home when I caught a glimpse of myself in the hallway mirror.

The irony is that talc is a mineral, yet that doesn’t stop most mineral makeup brands from avoiding its use due to unfounded health concerns. Mary Kay has crafted a fragrance-free loose-powder foundation with a superior smooth texture that feels almost creamy and blends beautifully. What you will get with this foundation is an initially sheer application with light to medium coverage (depending on how you layer it) that’s not nearly as heavy as that from several other mineral foundations. It also won’t give your face that “glow” or sparkling shine that mineral foundations are well known for (which may not be the best for someone with oily skin who might want a more a matte appearance from their powder application).The application brush (sold separately) does a respectable job, although the bristles are a bit stiff and I suspect many women will prefer a softer powder brush, which works far better for applying foundations like this one. The variety of shades are mostly impressive, neutral options. Bronze 1 will be too peach for most medium to tan skin tones, but Bronze 2 is a winner. If you’re curious to try a mineral foundation and don’t mind the mess they can cause (it is loose powder, after all, and Mary Kay doesn’t offer a tidy component), this is highly recommended as one of the best available, most notably for how great it looks on skin. As is the case with all mineral-type foundations, it can make dry skin or dry spots look worse unless they’re sufficiently prepped with moisturizer (and you must allow the moisturizer to absorb, or the powder will grab in spots and look uneven).","Mineral Powder Foundation","Mary Kay","",""

The original formula dispensed somewhat thick and then softened, eventually feeling quite light upon application providing even coverage.This reformulation remains a formidable makeup that exemplifies just how natural a foundation can look on skin. Procter & Gamble's pigment technology allows this makeup to cover minor flaws and even your skin tone without looking obvious (though just to be clear, no one will think you've gone bare-faced). This is indicative of what today's best foundations can accomplish, and although this is a very good foundation, Cover Girl's version isn't the only choice.The tricky aspect of this particular makeup is choosing a shade. That's true for any foundation, but Cover Girl tends to have more unnatural colors than its competitors, especially L'Oreal. Some of the lightest TruBlend shades go on an unattractive grayish pink, while others in the medium skin tone range are blatantly pink to rose. None of the following shades are recommended: Natural Ivory 415 (Cover Girl maintains this is the shade that actress Drew Barrymore wears in their ads, but there is no way this would match her skin tone), Classic Beige 430, Medium Light 435, Natural Beige 440, Creamy Beige 450, and Toasted Almond 470.The other nine shades are worth considering, and include options for fair and dark skin tones. Cover Girl's numbering system of 1 through 6 is designed to make it easier for you to pair their ""Tru"" line of products with each other. However, if you don't want to remain exclusive to this range of products (which is probably wise), it becomes a superfluous rating system.","TruBlend Liquid Makeup","CoverGirl","",""

While most mineral makeup comes in either loose- or pressed-powder form and containing both synthetic and natural ingredients, The Body Shop took a different approach with this foundation. Housed in a well-built compact, this is a very good cream-to-powder foundation for dry skin.
The butter-smooth texture glides on—although blending takes some effort because this has a tendency to streak and splotch. You’ll immediately see medium coverage that you can easily build to full without looking cakey. While The Body Shop claims this is a matte finish, it feels and looks significantly dewy, which makes sense given the emollient formula. Once it sets, the shininess of the finish dissipates to a satin matte look, but we noticed that it tended to pool slightly, accentuating pores.
The half moon–shaped synthetic brush included in the compact worked surprisingly well to apply this foundation, but you’ll need a small sponge to blend or get into smaller parts of the face, like under the eye or around the nose. Among the many shades, there are options for fair to dark skin tones, but in a foundation with this much pigment there’s very little room for a shade to be “off,” so experiment in the store and check the results on your skin in daylight before you buy.
As for the mineral makeup angle, please see More Info below to learn why it’s more marketing angle than a beauty breakthrough. Also refer to More Info for what is a confusing discrepancy regarding the claim that this foundation provides sun protection.
Pros:

Moisturizing formula for dry skin.
Leaves a dewy finish.
Provides medium coverage.
Fragrance-free.


Cons:

Careful blending is required to avoid a streaked or splotchy appearance.
After some wear, it can pool and accentuate enlarged pores.","Extra Virgin Minerals Compact Foundation","The Body Shop","",""

It's not quite runny, but it's certainly a lot thinner than many other liquid foundations, which can make blending difficult because it takes a bit of work to get smooth, uniform coverage with the slippery texture. Once blended, this lightweight foundation dries to a powder finish that doesn't emphasize lines or pores. Another bonus: It's fragrance-free.Regrettably, the shades are limited to only three colors, and only No. 1 Cream looks natural on its intended skin tone. The other two—No. 2 Nude and No. 3 Warm—are far too peach to blend naturally into their intended skin tones, making this an extremely limited option. Given the price, you could even go to the department store and get a better-performing foundation for less money!

There are very few differences between the formulas. The Supreme version still has a lot going for it, but as foundation technology has improved we're surprised that this liquid foundation has mostly stayed the same. It simply isn't as silky or elegant as many other liquid foundations designed for oily skin. But it remains worthy of consideration by anyone with normal to oily skin. The fluid, densely pigmented texture is dispensed from a pump and blends out to a seamless, soft matte finish with medium coverage that can appear thick unless you blend it meticulously. 12 shades are on hand, with options for very light but not for very dark skin tones. The only shades to consider avoiding are Shell Beige (slightly pink) and Suntan Beige (slightly peach). Porcelain Ivory is a very good shade for fair skin. Use caution with the darkest shades, as once these set they can look a bit ashen. Note: this foundation contains a high amount of the sunscreen ingredient ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate. Although this isn't a bad ingredient, some will find it sensitizing when applied around the eye area. If you notice stinging or burning around the eyes with this foundation, the sunscreen ingredient is the likely culprit.","Oil-Free Supreme Foundation","Laura Mercier","",""

The closest it comes to reducing the appearance of pores is by smoothing out your complexion and offering medium coverage, but that can be said of many foundations—no special technology here.The creamy, fluid texture requires a bit more blending than many liquid foundations, but once set, you can count on a matte finish that adequately stays in place. The formula is ideal for normal to oily skin, and the shade selection extends from light (but not fair) to deep skin tones in a range of flattering colors.So, why didn't this receive a good rating? Unfortunately, Clinique included some well-known irritants in the formula, such as denatured alcohol and witch hazel. (see More Info). The amounts are low enough so as not to be all that problematic, but it never makes sense to include ingredients that have no benefit for skin, especially when a product can be easily replaced by other options.Note: Although this contains the pore-shrinking ingredient salicylic acid, the amount is too low and the pH is not within range for it to function as an exfoliant. (Salicylic acid's exfoliating action is primarily how it works to reduce enlarged pores.)			
			
							
					Pros:
					
													Creamy, fluid texture offers medium coverage and stays put once set.
													Matte finish ideal for normal to oily skin.
													Flattering shades for light (but not fair) to deep skin tones.
											
				
			
							
					Cons:
					
													Won't actually shrink pores any more than any matte-finish foundation.
													Contains potential irritants.
													The amount of salicylic acid is too low to reduce large pores or breakouts (at least 1% is best, and it must be formulated in the proper pH range to work).
											
				
			
							
More Info:

Irritation, whether you see it on the surface of your skin or not, causes inflammation, and as a result impairs healing, damages collagen, and depletes the vital substances your skin needs to stay young. For this reason, it is best to eliminate, or minimize as much as possible, your exposure to known skin irritants, especially when there are brilliant formulas available that do not include these types of problematic ingredients (Sources: Inflammation Research, December 2008, pages 558–563; Skin Pharmacology and Physiology, June 2008, pages 124–135, and November-December 2000, pages 358–371; Journal of Investigative Dermatology, April 2008, pages 15–19; Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology, March 2008, pages 78–82; Mechanisms of Ageing and Development, January 2007, pages 92–105; and British Journal of Dermatology, December 2005, pages S13–S22.)","Pore Refining Solutions Instant Perfecting Makeup","Clinique","",""

Despite the visual and formulary novelty, it turns out that both the inner and outer cores have similar ingredients; each contains powder-like ingredients and waxes that aren't the best for those struggling with clogged pores (the waxes help keep this foundation in stick form). So, in that sense, separating the inner and outer cores is more a marketing angle than a special formula for your skin.
Best for normal to combination skin not prone to breakouts, this glides on as one color, and each shade tends to go on more pink or peach than it looks in the packaging. Pink or peach would normally be a problem, but once blended, the pink-to-peach tones soften (and lighten) to reveal a more neutral, skin-like color. That's great, because Maybelline offers a dozen shades, and the mix includes good options for fair (but not very light) to dark (but not very dark) skin tones. You don't need to avoid any of the shades, but the color change that occurs when blending makes it a little trickier than usual to select the shade that's best for you.
What's particularly impressive about this stick foundation is how easily it blends and how natural it looks. This won't give you medium to full coverage, but it's great for sheer to light coverage and has a silky, surprisingly weightless matte finish.
If you're wondering just how long this keeps excess shine from showing up—it depends. Worn alone (meaning no moisturizer, serum, etc. applied underneath) you're likely to get at least 3 hours of shine control unless you have very oily skin, in which case you can count on an hour or less. Worn with other products, such as a lightweight daytime moisturizer with sunscreen, you can get a couple hours of reliable shine control—more if you set it with powder. That may not sound too impressive, but it's better than many other stick or cream-to-powder foundations.

Smooth Finish Powder Foundation has all the great features of the former version, and adds some new benefits. This is a luxuriously smooth, talc-based powder that works incredibly well on normal to oily skin because it doesn't oxidize or darken when it mixes with the skin's oil.This powder offers buildable coverage, from light-medium to full. The demi-matte finish mimics the natural look of skin without adding extra shine or ever looking powdered. The mirrored compact does include a latex sponge that's workable for touchups, but the product applies better with a powder brush.Compared to the original Powder Foundation, the shade range has expanded considerably, and all are recommended. With such a large selection, there's sure to be a workable option, whether you have a very light or a very deep skin tone (there's not a bad color in the bunch). Although it's certainly not necessary to spend this much on powder foundation, this one is worth checking out if it comfortably fits within your beauty budget.			
			
							
					Pros:
					
													Fragrance-free.
													Luxuriously smooth.
													Attractive demi-matte finish.
													Doesn't oxidize or darken on oily skin.
													Buildable coverage that never looks chalky or powdered.

I have oily skin with bad acne scarring as well as new acne that comes up regularly. I have never noticed a product really breaking me out, my acne is hormonal and caused by stress, but this foundation has caused my oil problem to increase. Not only does the foundation slide off my face and start to break apart on my skin, even after washing it off my face just always feels extra oily. I had researched so many foundations and decided I wanted to try this one. The price of it was pretty low for a high-end brand and it was supposed to be full coverage. The coverage was no better than my Revlon Colorstay foundation, and that's really sad. Though the coverage can be built up, it gets cakey quickly. Also, the color selection is a joke. The lightest color seemed my color, but for someone who was peach undertones to my skin, it was too pinky. My arms are yellowish, but my neck/face are very peachy, making finding a good foundation very hard, but professionals have always matched me with pink. The lightest foundation is PINK! The next shade up is too dark for me, and though it is supposed to be beige, is very very orange/pink. I had read so many reviews, most of them having negative things to say, but I wanted to see for myself. Most of the time when people say a foundation is cakey, it is because they are not applying it with a moisturizer or with too much primer, but I tried this foundation so many times and always was unhappy with it. The more I try it, the more I hate it. I still love Kat Von D, but this foundation is not for me. Maybe people with normal skin will like it, but it does not like my oily skin at all."

Although it would be easy to characterize this as another “me, too!” mineral makeup, it was on the scene before many other cosmetics companies jumped on the mineral makeup bandwagon. Does that mean this one is the best option? That depends on your expectations and preferences, but as you’ll see, there is much to compliment. Before commenting further, let me explain the 4-in-1 claim. The company claims this product functions as sunscreen, foundation, powder, and concealer, all in one. It certainly qualifies as a powder and, when layered, provides coverage that approximates what most traditional (liquid) foundations provide. However, its use as a concealer is bound to disappoint because it doesn’t provide as much coverage as today’s best concealers, plus the formula contains ingredients that are too occlusive for use on acne and too absorbent for use in dry areas, including under the eyes. The sunscreen element is applicable only if you apply this liberally, something most women won’t do because it tends to create a heavy, powdered look. Although the sole active ingredient is titanium dioxide, this works best as an adjunct to your regular sunscreen, not as a replacement. Therefore, this isn’t a foundation to consider if you’re hoping to toss your concealer and sunscreen. However, it does have a beautiful smooth, dry texture that applies evenly and looks natural as it provides light to medium coverage. The finish is matte but laced with sparkles, which can make oily areas look oilier, although the sparkles aren’t nearly as prevalent as they are in several other mineral foundations. The sparkles do, however, add a soft glow that keeps skin from looking flat and one-dimensional. The fragrance-free, mica-based formula is best for normal to slightly dry or slightly oily skin. Those with dry skin all over will find this too absorbent; those with oily skin will find it isn’t absorbent enough. By the way, almost all of the mineral ingredients in this powder foundation are present in other pressed and loose powders that make no mention of minerals, and the bismuth oxychloride and boron nitride are about as natural as polyester. As for the shades, most are neutral and there are options for fair to dark, but not very dark, skin tones. Consider Blush Medium carefully because it is slightly peach and can turn color when used over oily areas. Deeper is slightly orange, but workable, while Deepest is a dark shade that doesn’t have an ashen finish. Note: This foundation’s rating is due to its overall performance rather than its SPF rating. Due to concerns about people not applying sunscreen liberally enough to get the amount of SPF protection stated on the label, it is often recommended to look for SPFs with ratings higher than 15. If you plan to use foundation as your sole source of facial sun protection, consider using one rated SPF 30 or greater. If the foundation with sunscreen you choose is rated less than an SPF 30, we strongly advise applying it over a daytime moisturizer rated SPF 15 or greater and following it with a pressed powder rated SPF 15 or greater. That way, you’re ensuring sufficient broad-spectrum protection which is essential for having and maintaining healthy, younger-looking skin at any age.","4-in-1 Pressed Mineral Makeup SPF 15","Pürminerals","",""

Another anti-aging ingredient touted on the package is vitamin C (as tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate) but there is so little in this foundation, your skin won’t even notice it. Although it is clever and convenient that this initially creamy liquid foundation is dispensed onto a built-in brush, it does little to enhance application. It also doesn’t change the fact that no matter how much blending you do, this foundation always looks heavy and somewhat opaque, with a flat, slightly chalky finish.

When you dispense some of this liquid foundation from the squeeze tube packaging, what you get is a runny, white liquid with small balls of powdered pigment that burst into color when they’re blended. So, make no mistake, it’s not intuition at work here; the color’s transformation is simply a result of that powdered pigment being released into the liquid as you blend. The problem is that these pigment spheres don’t break down easily, and because coverage is sheer, the graininess and streaking left behind is noticeable. Even worse, there’s a filminess to the dry finish that’s uncomfortable, unflattering, and quite sticky to the touch. This product also contains several irritating fragrance chemicals.

I would call it medium and it doesn't matter if I apply with a sponge or a foundation brush.  It really does stay for a long time.  More than 8 hours.

For instance, this is lightweight feeling and not at all heavy, the liquid was easy to blend onto my skin and looked natural. It didn't feel greasy on my oily skin, and it didn't cause breakouts (as far as I could notice). It stays put and doesn't migrate onto your enlarged pores, etc. I can't speak to how this performs on dry/flaky spots because I never have dry skin.
The biggest downside for me is that the coverage just isn't enough for my acne prone skin, because you need something to help cover up the old red marks. This foundation evens out your complexion somewhat, but nothing beyond that. When I use this, I have to put concealer on even my lightest of acne marks, and it doesn't provide much coverage for the slight redness I have around my nose due to allergies. So I would describe the coverage as sheer to light.
Regarding the color, I bought the ""ivory"". My skin tone is between fair and medium, and very neutral so foundations usually leave me looking orange or pink. The ivory matched my skin well, and the product did not oxidise and change color on me.
I paid about $18 CAD for a bottle, so it wasn't THAT expensive but given its performance, I wouldn't buy it again.
I would recommend this to people with oily skin because it is lightweight and not oily, and to people who want something to enhance their complexion rather than to help cover redness or ""spottiness"" from acne."

It's the preferred alternative to AmazingCosmetics's Velvet Mineral Loose Powder Foundation because the pressed-powder version is much more convenient to use, it applies easily, and there isn't any loose-powder mess.This silky, fragrance-free powder blends evenly and provides light to medium coverage. Those with normal to slightly oily skin will appreciate the dry matte texture, which is perfect for keeping excess oil in check. The subtle satin finish is attractive, but it may not be ideal for those with very oily skin who prefer a true matte finish.As for the shades, there are options for light to medium skin tones. However, the undertones are consistently warm—like most color products fromAmazingCosmetics—and the darker shades may have too much red in them to look flattering on the darker skin tones for which the shade was designed.One disappointment is that, unlike most mineral powders, this does not provide sun protection. Mineral makeup certainly isn't a must-have, but if it's your preference, there are better options available that at least include sunscreen so that during the day you will get the anti-aging benefits sunscreen provides.

Its texture is beautifully smooth, almost creamy-feeling, yet unless you apply this with a brush it manages to look powdery and somewhat dry on skin.Make Up For Ever includes a sponge housed in the underside of the compact, but we don't advise using the sponge unless you want a heavy, powdered look and medium to full coverage. Applied with a brush, coverage is in the sheer to light range, which makes this product much more attractive. It is also suitable for sensitive skin because it does not contain fragrance.We mentioned the shade range above, and it's exemplary. Considering there are more than two dozen colors, it's impressive that only a handful of them should be considered carefully or avoided: Shade 130 is too rosy and should be avoided; shade 153 is workable yet errs toward being too yellow; shade 165 is slightly peach, but worth a try; and shade 180 is not recommended because it's too terracotta-orange.Note: Make Up For Ever states this foundation can be applied wet, and it does work well (no streaking) in this regard. Wet application provides sheer coverage and a natural matte finish, with none of the over-powdered issues seen when using the included sponge dry.

The limited shade range is categorized for light to deep skin tones, but not every color is flattering (the Medium/Deep shade is on the orangey side).This foundation's mousse-like texture means it has a bouncy feel that is easy to blend. It offers medium coverage that makes skin tone look seamlessly even. The formula sets to a soft matte finish that works well for all skin types, even oily. If you can find a shade that works for you, this is an excellent option.Because this is packaged in a jar, use a clean brush or sponge (not your fingers) for the most hygienic application. Also, the formula contains fragrance in the form of ethylene brassylate, but in such a low amount it's not likely to be irritating.

Ironically, the antioxidants are paired with an ingredient that delivers oxygen to the skin—so in effect they cancel each other out (more on the oxygen issue below.The shade range is workable for light to medium deep skin tones, but that's it—lighter to darker skin tones won't find options.Back to the oxygen contradiction. This foundation delivers oxygen to the skin via an ingredient called perflurodecalin. While there is a study that shows this ingredient improves skin's ability to hold moisture, it also says the results are not conclusive, and it is only one study (International Journal of Cosmetic Science, June 1996). On the other hand, there also are studies showing perflurodecalin can cause free-radical damage and inhibit blood flow. One thing is definite, however, there are no studies showing it can repair wrinkles or prevent them from occurring.  And even if bringing more oxygen to skin was a good thing, the antioxidants in this foundation work against the oxygen!Aside from the dubious oxygen claims, there is a lot to like about this fragrance-free foundation, but it has a one more significant flaw, discussed below.A larger concern and part of the reason for this foundation's poor rating is the inclusion of the preservative methylisothiazolinone. This preservative is a known irritant whose use in leave-on products is generally not recommended (Sources: Contact Dermatitis, December 2012, pages 334–341, and November 2011, pages 276–285). Because the amount of this preservative appears to be greater than usual, we cannot recommend this foundation despite some strong positives.

													Fragrance-free.
													Lightweight liquid is easy to blend and looks natural.
													Formula includes some notable antioxidants.
											
				
			
							
					Cons:
					
													Contains more preservative (in this case, phenoxyethanol) than anti-aging ingredients.
													Also contains the preservative methylisothiazolinone, which can be sensitizing, and the amount in this foundation is cause for concern.","IT-O2 Ultra Repair Liquid Oxygen Foundation","IT Cosmetics","",""

I've been a fan ever since!  I use the Light Tan shade and I've been very satisfied with the color, appearance, texture, natural look, ease of use and all-over-face coverage. One thing I do that helps with applying any brand of powder foundation, is applying a good primer first.  I agree with the expert review that PUR doesn't work well as a concealer, but that's a minor issue for me. 

I switched from BareMinerals and here are my reasons:
I was using BareMinerals powders for over 5 years because I prefer a natural no-makeup look and it worked great for that purpose. Liquid foundations are either too greasy, dewy or sticky after applying to the oily parts of my face. The main issue I've always had with BareMinerals powder is that it takes too many steps to apply (i.e. pour foundation powder into lid, swirl brush, tap to remove excess; then repeat with Mineral Veil).  I tried the BareMinerals Ready pressed powder and it's messy - as you're swirling the powder, powder flies all over the place."

Those with oily skin will appreciate the shine control this provides, but if you have very oily skin, this won't keep shine at bay all day long, despite the claims to the contrary.The fluid texture blends on smoothly, offering sheer coverage that meshes well with skin. The herbal part of the name comes into play because this contains antioxidants, such as Ginkgo biloba leaf extract and Panax ginseng root extract, which are nice additions, but nothing to get overly excited about because the amounts are low and because there are better antioxidants than these two.The formula also contains fragrance, which can be irritating to skin at high concentrations, but at the low amount in this product, it's not much cause for concern (and doesn't keep this foundation from earning our top rating).The shade range offers options for fair to deep skin tones, and we found that the shades go on more neutral than they appear in the tube (which is a good thing). All in all, we must say this was a surprisingly nice addition to the Palladio beauty family, and a great option for those with normal to oily skin!

When applied with a sponge, all the glitter remained on my face and it looked slightly ridiculous. Other than the glitter, I liked this foundation. If you don't mind very light, dewey foundations and lots of glitter, you will likely enjoy it."

The texture is more wet than creamy, which means it blends unevenly, and as the foundation dries it tends to ball up, which makes it difficult to build any substantial coverage (or to move on to the next step in your makeup routine).Another issue with this foundation is the shade range. Although there are options for light to medium dark skin tones, the majority of the shades have pink undertones, making it difficult to find an appropriate match for yellow, olive, or warm skin tones.Note: This product doesn't have any added fragrance, but it does have a very strong odor.			
			
							
					Pros:
					
													Fragrance-free.
											
				
			
							
					Cons:
					
													Most of the shades are too pink or rose to work for those who have a natural yellow undertone to their skin (which is almost everyone, regardless of whether their skin is fair or dark).

ColorStay Whipped Crème Makeup offers several flattering shades for light to deep skin tones with medium to full coverage that holds up well throughout the day. Just be sure to not apply it too thickly or it will look cakey and overdone.

The jar packaging is heavy and cumbersome, so make sure you're OK with that before buying (this isn't a foundation that's ideal for traveling with). Also, in regard to the jar packaging, although it does compromise the effectiveness of the antioxidants, those ingredients are typically an after-thought for makeup. Be sure to use a clean brush or sponge (not fingers) for the most hygienic application.
Pros:

Mousse-like texture blends smoothly and evenly.
Cream-to-powder, satin matte finish works for normal to oily skin.
Fragrance-free.

It's also very easy to apply, things doesn't get messy with the powder, and the pigment doesn't cling to the small hairs on your face, which can be the case with some powder foundations out there. One part of me wants to give this a 5 star rating, BUT I'm hesitant since I after three months of use developed small breakouts which then became real bad cystic acne and in the end needed isitretonin and left bad scars on my face. I have had acne for 15 years now (I'm 28) and had a previous round of iso 6 years ago. So I don't know if the acne was a coincident this time or if it was somehow triggered by the product? I stopped using the product a month after the acne got worse, but that did not help, so I'm assuming it was NOT because of the foundation? I really wish I knew, because this pressed mineral foundation really is the best one out there, but haven't dared to buy it again in two years after the acne attack..."

It provides sheer to medium coverage and, although it feels matte, it has a luminous finish that can be a bit too shiny for oily skin. It's best for normal to slightly oily skin.There are shades for very light to dark skin tones, but the majority of shades for the lighter skin tones have pink undertones—110 Honey and 112 Amber are especially pink, and because pink is not anyone's natural skin color, these shades are best avoided. Aside from the too-pink shades, this foundation performs surprisingly well. The superior packaging manages to mitigate the messiness often associated with loose powders, and it even houses a usable kabuki brush inside the cap.Note: Although we'd prefer this foundation to be fragrance-free (because that's best for skin), the small amount of fragrance that's included isn't cause for concern unless you have extra-sensitive skin.			
			
							
					Pros:
					
													Soft texture blends easily.
													Buildable sheer to medium coverage.
													Makes skin look smoother and more even.
													Superior packaging; isn't messy like most loose powders.
													Includes a worthwhile, full-size synthetic-hair kabuki brush.
											
				
			
							
					Cons:
					
													The shades tend toward cool tones; 110 Honey and 112 Amber have especially pink undertones.

While not the cleanest option out there (there will be excess powder to deal with no matter what you do, a disappointing feature of all loose powders), the sifter plus the formula's creaminess does help keep it from flying all over the place like some drier powders might.This fragrance-free foundation applies easily and blends seamlessly into skin for an airbrushed finish, as advertised. It must be said, though, that to achieve full coverage you have to put a lot of it on. We used it to cover up facial redness, and it took at least two or three passes with our makeup brush before the redness was eliminated, and it can end up looking more noticeable than a traditional liquid foundation. The amount of coverage you can achieve without it looking heavy is only light to medium, which will be a disappointment for people expecting full coverage from a quick application.Amazonian Clay Full Coverage Airbrush Foundation wears well for several hours without fading, and despite it being a powder, doesn't emphasize pores or wrinkles throughout its wear time. Those with very dry skin will find this too drying (all powders absorb moisture), but it's a good option for people with normal to combination skin. This foundation comes in shades ranging from very light to very dark, and all appear natural on their intended skin tones.Overall, a good foundation option—just keep in mind that for full coverage, you might need to look elsewhere!

While this all sounds amazing, the truth is that many of these ingredients will start losing their effectiveness as soon as you open the compact. Long story short: Don't purchase this on the basis of its anti-aging claims alone—those ingredients won't last for long in this type of packaging.As for the foundation itself, it's merely average. It provides medium coverage (not completely full coverage as claimed) and comes in five shades, which are yellow-based enough to appear natural on many skin tones.This powder feels silky and doesn't fade; however, it also tends to accentuate dry spots on the face and can highlight larger pores, which is strange, because powder is generally good at minimizing the appearance of pores.

Coverall Cream Foundation has a fluid, liquid-cream texture that blends smoothly into the skin to impart a natural-looking, satin-matte finish with medium coverage. The shade range spans from fair to tan skin tones, and each shade goes on more natural-looking than it initially appears.The downside is that this foundation doesn't last all day as claimed … particularly in oily areas. Normal to dry skin types will have better luck, but in either case, try setting this with a pressed powder for longer wear.One caution: This contains a small amount of the preservative methylisothiazolinone, which is known to be sensitizing and generally is not recommended for use in leave-on products. It's up to you whether or not you want to take that gamble with your skin, but you can always check out our Best Foundations Without Sunscreen list for alternative options that don't contain this preservative.

However, it's limited to skin that's not oily or too dry.This comes in a screw-top container with a sponge provided. We recommend using a foundation brush or blending sponge (such as Beauty Blender) instead, as the flat sponge that's included tends to drag this foundation across the face instead of providing smooth application. With a brush or better sponge, though, it applies very easily.Time Balm is natural looking, with a satin finish that lasts several hours, and it definitely covers up redness, brown spots, and other skin imperfections. Because it's a cream foundation, we don't recommend it for people with oily skin (as it will not last long), and it's not quite moisturizing enough for people with very dry skin. For those with normal to slightly dry skin, though, this is worth checking out.Time Balm wears well throughout the day, emphasizing wrinkles only after about eight hours of wear, and it doesn't show pores at all! It comes in a variety of shades that look natural on their intended skin tones, including options for very light to medium dark skin.

Before we go into detail, keep in mind that the minerals in almost all mineral makeup products are the same ones that show up (and have been showing up) in pressed and loose powders for decades. Don't mistake mineral makeup for something special, because for all intents and purposes, it's just a marketing twist, not a new or revolutionary type of makeup.Marketing hype aside, what makes this fragrance-free pressed-powder foundation so remarkable is its polished, natural-looking sheer matte finish. The formula leaves a subtle shine so it doesn't make skin look flat, but in terms of how this feels and how well it keeps shine in check, it's matte.The texture is on the dry side and a bit difficult to pick up with a brush, but with patience and practice, this is easy to apply, and its finish is simply beautiful, never dull or powdery. Unlike some mineral powders, this doesn't provide heavy coverage; sheer to just-medium coverage is what you can expect.As impressive as the finish is, the shades go even further! There are two dozen colors, a range made even more extraordinary because there's not a bad one in the bunch! Even the dark shades look great (not ashen), and there are colors for fair skin, too. Well done, Cover FX!Pressed Mineral Foundation is best for combination to oily skin and is suitable for sensitive skin, too.			
			
							
					Pros:
					
													Fragrance-free, smooth-textured formula.
													Gorgeous, extensive, neutral shades.
													Makes skin look polished and perfected, not dry or powdered.
													Isn't as heavy-looking as many other mineral powders.

The talc-based formula has an extremely fine, silky texture that slips on like a second skin. Application is as smooth and even as it gets, and it sets to a natural matte finish that’s not the least bit dry or chalky. Coverage isn’t on a par with what many consumers expect from a powder foundation, but as long as you’re OK with that trade-off (and the price), you’ll be pleased. All of the shades are beautiful and each goes on lighter than it appears. Because of this, it is imperative that you test Compact Makeup on your skin before deciding which shade to purchase. This foundation is best for normal to dry or slightly oily skin.Interestingly, Chantecaille denigrates talc in claims made for other products they sell, boasting that they don’t contain this tainted ingredient, but this product contains it front and center.

We were torn on how to rate this given it can have a beautiful finish if applied expertly, but we kept coming back to this question: Should your foundation require this much effort?One the positive, this fragrance-free buildable, medium-to-full coverage foundation is pigmented enough to cover discolorations and blemishes, as well as providing at least partial coverage of tattoos. The creamy texture blends well during application and dries down to a long-wearing semi-matte powder finish and a little goes a long way.It is best for oily to combination skin due to its matte finish, which tends to wear well for most of the workday. However, those with super oily skin may find this can pool into enlarged pores if not blended well.Here is where things can go awry—Lock-It Tattoo Foundation can be a challenge to blend out due to its thickness coupled with the fact it dries very fast on skin. Once this dries, it doesn’t budge, so the slightest mistake during application isn’t easy to remove.We also found that this formula can be unpredictable, primarily in that if you applied just slightly more foundation than is needed, it had a tendency to crease into fine lines and wrinkles throughout the day.To the color range. At the time of this review, Kat Von D offers a wide range of shade options, suited for those with fair skin to deep skin tones. This is a good thing, as a skin tone match is critical with this formula due to its high degree of pigment coupled with the fact this doesn’t sheer out easily.Bottom Line: If you’re considering this formula, be sure to get an in-store color match.Ultimately, we would have loved to have given this a higher rating, but Lock-It Tattoo Foundation is just too tricky to work with unless you’re well adept at makeup application and can move with the speed and accuracy of a ninja with your makeup tools. If that’s you, we would say this is worth checking out if a medium-to-full coverage formula is what you’re after.  Otherwise, we would recommend checking out the alternative formulas in our list of Best Foundations instead.

Currently, this is my everyday foundation because of budget limits. My skin is not nice, I have hyper pigmentation, wrinkles and many acne scars. I also have a VERY oily t-zone. This foundation cannot keep me oil free for even 3 hours. Because you don't Stay matte, I took a star off. That said it doesn't make me more oily than I am, which is nice. The foundation feels very light weight and gives medium coverage. It cannot be layered for more coverage. It is long wearing though, and it doesn't break down with average sweat or oiliness during the day. This foundation isn't HG for me because it doesn't help smooth my skin texture, or give me a matte radiance (unlike loreal' pro Matte which does, though that foundation is inferior to this one in many KEY respects). That said, this is unlikely to clog your pores, its water based, gives natural looking medium, matte coverage, doesn't separate under sweat and oil, its long wearing, unscented as far as I can tell, and affordable. This is a solid 4 stars out of 5. I would recommend this to any young people (under 30) with combination to oily skin looking for their first foundation, or anyone if they have an awesome primer/powder combo that smooths their skin already, or has smooth skin like Tati from Youtube. I apply this with a real techniques expert face brush and it blends in super easy. Im around NC 42-43 and the closest match is 15 Beige.

When dispensed (even when you’re being careful), it shoots out in a bubbly mound, which quickly begins to dissolve into a puddle of creamy liquid foundation that feels wet and runny as you apply.As you might imagine, it’s difficult to get even application with a foundation whose consistency is bubbly, and indeed the biggest problem with this foundation is its tendency to streak and apply unevenly. It does provide light to medium coverage, but its gimmicky delivery system, difficult-to-use texture, and unnaturally shiny finish are major, and ridiculous,drawbacks.If the texture and application aren’t enough to dissuade you, this foundation is also loaded with flecks of shimmer that tend to sink into lines and exaggerate wrinkles.

It contains salicylic acid as the anti-acne active, but in an amount that's too low (0.6%) and at a pH that's too high (pH 6) to be helpful for skin. Even though the salicylic acid in this makeup won't help with blemishes, this still offers an enviably smooth, liquid texture that blends onto skin with ease, providing light to medium coverage and a natural matte finish. It is a great example of how beautiful a foundation can look on the skin. Less than a dozen shades are available, but almost all of them are exquisite. Only Warm should be viewed with caution as it may be too peach for some medium to tan skin tones. There are no options for very light or dark skin tones. One caution: Because of the salicylic acid, this product should not be used around the eyes or on the eyelids. This foundation is one to try if you have normal to very oily skin, though it would need to be paired with an effective sunscreen rated SPF 15 or higher for daytime use.","Clear Complexion Makeup BlemisHeal Technology","Almay","",""

Five minutes into wear, there are signs of trouble.The first and most obvious drawback is that this foundation, regardless of the shade, changes color over time. It begins by turning a pale tone of orange, and then continues darkening.It also feels heavy on skin and the coverage doesn't last. Of the numerous shades, there are plenty of options for light to-medium skin tones. The semi-matte finish and formula are best for most skin types, but overall you just can't trust the color–and when it comes to foundation that's everything.
Pros:

Blendable, creamy-liquid texture.
Provides decent coverage for minor flaws.


Cons:

Color changes once applied, becoming considerably darker throughout the day.
Once it sets, it feels somewhat heavy on skin.
Coverage fades within hours.

More Info:The inclusion of witch hazel extract isn't great to see on the label, but this irritating ingredient is likely present in too low an amount to be cause for concern. Still, for the health of your skin it's best to avoid exposure to irritating ingredients, because irritation, whether you see it on the surface of skin or not, causes inflammation and as a result impairs healing, damages collagen, and depletes vital substances your skin needs to stay young. For this reason, it is best to minimize or eliminate as much as possible your exposure to known skin irritants, especially considering there are brilliant formulas available that avoid these types of problematic ingredients.","Clean Finish Foundation","Rimmel","",""

It's so moisturizing that if you have even remotely oily areas, this will prove far too emollient and slip off by mid-day.Radiant Cream Compact Foundation provide light to medium coverage with an attractive dewy finish that doesn't highlight pores or wrinkles. Though a sponge is included in the compact, we would recommend applying this with a buffing brush for the best result, as a sponge can deposit far too much product on your face.Like many of the NARS foundation range, this comes in a generous range of shades, with colors for very light and very dark skin tones, although the Mont Blanc shade does have a stronger pink undertone that tends to look unnatural, even on fair complexions.It's also worth noting that NARS chose a different approach to the packaging for this foundation. The foundation and compact are sold separately. For $38 you get a relatively small amount of foundation in a lightweight plastic container that you snap in to the compact, the latter of which adds $10 to the total price. This may be initially off-putting, but if you find this foundation to be a favorite, you may appreciate the money saved in the long run. We listed the price of the foundation without the compact because it is usable this way, but it holds up much better in the sold-separately compact.Note: This contains some antioxidants, but they won't remain stable given that this foundation will be routinely exposed to light and air during each use.

It has some positive aspects, but they're not enough to make this truly stand out, especially not for $52!This is a sheer- to medium-coverage liquid foundation, similar to a tinted moisturizer, that smoothes on easily and dries to a very natural semi-matte finish. It won't cover major flaws, but it does a good job of evening out skin tone. The finish doesn't highlight pores or wrinkles, and it is long-wearing as claimed.A major drawback is that this foundation is billed as being moisturizing, but those with dry to very dry skin will find that this does not do an adequate job of keeping their skin quenched. In fact, it feels drying as soon as it goes on, even with moisturizer underneath!You might think this foundation's dry feel could be a bonus for people with oily skin, but those with oily T-zones will likely notice shine becoming apparent about midway through the day. What a disappointment, for both skin types!Sheer Foundation has so much fragrance (sort of a cross between a chemical smell and a baby powder scent) that you can smell it as soon as you open the container, and the scent lingers for quite some time after it's on your face! This is really unusual because most liquid foundations omit fragrance, or, if it's part of the formula, it's far more subtle. See More Info to learn why daily use of highly fragrant products is a problem for skin.Sheer Foundation has a limited shade range, but does include options for those with very fair and very dark skin. Avoid the Trench No. 202 shade, however, as it's far too pink to appear natural on its intended skin tone. All in all, there are much better sheer makeup options at both the department store and the drugstore!			
			
							
					Pros:

													Does a good job of evening out skin tone.
													Doesn't highlight pores or wrinkles.
													Long-wearing as claimed.
											
				
			
							
					Cons:
					
													Not moisturizing as claimed.
													Those with oily T-zone will notice a shine about midway through the day.
													Strong fragrance that you can smell long after it's been applied, and fragrance can be irritating for skin.
											
				
			
							
More Info:
Daily use of products that contain a high amount of fragrance, whether the fragrant ingredients are synthetic or natural, causes chronic irritation that can damage healthy collagen production, lead to or worsen dryness, and impair your skin's ability to heal. Fragrance-free is the best way to go for all skin types. If fragrance in your skin-care products is important to you, it should be a very low amount to minimize the risk to your skin (Sources: Inflammation Research, December 2008, pages 558–563; Skin Pharmacology and Physiology, June 2008, pages 124–135, and November-December 2000, pages 358–371; Journal of Investigative Dermatology, April 2008, pages 15–19; Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology, March 2008, pages 78–82; Mechanisms of Ageing and Development, January 2007, pages 92–105; and British Journal of Dermatology, December 2005, pages S13–S22).","Sheer Foundation","Burberry Beauty","",""

I have had acne for 15 years now (I'm 28) and had a previous round of iso 6 years ago. So I don't know if the acne was a coincident this time or if it was somehow triggered by the product?

On the plus side, this is indeed a moisturizing foundation suitable for dry skin. It leaves a moist, satin finish and contains some notable plant oils to keep skin smoothed and hydrated. The light cream texture smooths easily over skin, providing medium to almost full coverage from only a small amount of product.The major drawback is that once set, this tends to look heavy and very much like makeup sitting on the skin as opposed to meshing with it for a more natural, yet refined, appearance. The finish also tends to sink into and magnify wrinkles and definitely highlights areas with enlarged pores (though large pores are typically not a complaint for women with dry skin).Turning to the shades, there are some beautiful options for fair to dark skin tones, along with some that are a must to avoid. Porcelain Ivory is excellent for very light skin, assuming you’re willing to tolerate that this foundation really looks like makeup. Colors to avoid include the rosy-pink Shell Beige, slightly orange Honey Beige, and coppery Toffee Bronze  (though this may work for certain dark skin tones).Note: This foundation contains the sunscreen ingredient ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate. Although it is not rated with an SPF and should not be relied on for sun protection, the sunscreen ingredient this contains can be a problem when used around the eyes (such as on the eyelid area). If you notice signs of stinging or eye irritation, this ingredient is the likely culprit.","Moisture Supreme Foundation","Laura Mercier","",""

Only three shades are available, because each shade (light, light/medium, and medium) is supposed to ""instinctively"" adjust depending on your skin tone—which, of course, it can't; no product can know what skin color you have. Each shade starts out white with tiny brownish beads, and as it's blended the beads burst, revealing the color. Each shade has a set amount of pigment that is similar to that of a tinted moisturizer, and each provides sheer to medium coverage.This foundation goes on as a silky liquid and sets to a powdery finish, making it best for normal to oily skin. The color matches may prove difficult for very light or very dark skin, but testers are available in most stores. Just keep in mind that the visual trickery isn't this foundation magically adjusting to your skin tone; either the shade you're considering will work or it won't, same as for every other foundation.Formula-wise, we're pleased to report that this contains some good antioxidants and skin-repairing ingredients, and it's fragrance-free.

Granted, I have very sensitive skin and the main reactions I have from problem ingredients are either flaking/dryness, or acne. This one did not cause any flaking but it unfortunately did cause breakouts.

Pros:
Very affordable
Good color match for my fair with pink undertones
Nice coverage
Nice finish (requires setting powder in my experience)
Doesn't dry me out

Cons:
Jar packaging is awkward for travel and for application (I am not a fan of dipping into any product, personally, but it's doable with a small spatula -- just an added step)

It's the first foundation for light skin I've been able to find that isn't too peachy toned or too pink. It's truly a neutral dk beige that delivers beautiful looking skin. And it stays that color all day. Most foundations turn peachy (oxidize) on me after only ~30 mins, no matter how pricey they are. Like others below, I regularly get compliments on my skin when I wear this.

For comparison, IT's CC foundation starts the same great color but doesn't stay that way on me. It turns peach like everything else. It's also far more visible even before it turns. It doesn't blend in like this one does. The texture of this O2 foundation is second to none in looking like it's just your own glowing skin.

Granted, I have very sensitive skin and the main reactions I have from problem ingredients are either flaking/dryness, or acne. This one did not cause any flaking but it unfortunately did cause breakouts.

Pros:
Very affordable
Good color match for my fair with pink undertones
Nice coverage
Nice finish (requires setting powder in my experience)
Doesn't dry me out

Cons:
Jar packaging is awkward for travel and for application (I am not a fan of dipping into any product, personally, but it's doable with a small spatula -- just an added step)

It feels silky and sets to a long-wearing matte finish that doesn’t look too powdery or flat. Perhaps the best news is that the shades are mostly exemplary. The only ones to avoid due to obvious overtones of peach or pink include Y-4, P-2, P-3, and P-4. Shade P-5 is also not recommended due to a strong copper tone.

As my skin changes with age, I've been searching for a light foundation that provides coverage and doesn't feel heavy greasy or sinks into my pores and lines like the liquid foundations.
I saw this at a local drugstore and had never heard of it before but thought, hey, I've been trying many but haven't found any I like so I gave it a try. It's not cheap! I can't tell you how many jars and bottles and tubes of foundation I've tried a few times and just shook my head and onto the next but this stuff is just simply amazing.
The best way to describe is elegant. It is soft, light, a lot goes a long way and provides quick even coverage for dark circles, blemishes and uneven skintone. I am on the oily to dry side and this provided great matte coverage for 8 hrs ( I blotted in between with Quo blotters). I use a sponge to apply it with but it also goes on great with fingers.

And for oily or young skin, this might be a great fit! I also like several of this company's products. 

However, for this powder foundation, it just wasn't a good fit for me. I don't have oily skin. Nor young skin. A fair dusting for minimal coverage worked okay, but I ended up having to use a tinted sunscreen moisturizer as well, beforehand, and the powder acted more like a setting powder than a foundation (and gave a very matte finish, which works for oily skin, but not my dry skin). A heavier application for medium coverage made my skin look so heavy it seemed to sag. I looked older -- which is the last thing I wanted.

And transference was an issue, even with setting spray. 

In the end, I could not use this long enough to tell if it actually provided additional benefits to my skin from long-term use (as it claims). If I were in my 20s, or had oily skin (or both!) I think this could've worked well. However, for my mature prone-to-dryness skin, this simply couldn't work for me. 

In addition, I have very fair skin, but Porcelain made me look a bit dead. The next shade up was too dark (looked orange on me). Medium tones and beyond may be fine, but they need an in between shade for their light shades.

I chose No, I would not recommend this to a friend, because my friends are all over 40."

For instance, this is lightweight feeling and not at all heavy, the liquid was easy to blend onto my skin and looked natural. It didn't feel greasy on my oily skin, and it didn't cause breakouts (as far as I could notice). It stays put and doesn't migrate onto your enlarged pores, etc. I can't speak to how this performs on dry/flaky spots because I never have dry skin.
The biggest downside for me is that the coverage just isn't enough for my acne prone skin, because you need something to help cover up the old red marks. This foundation evens out your complexion somewhat, but nothing beyond that. When I use this, I have to put concealer on even my lightest of acne marks, and it doesn't provide much coverage for the slight redness I have around my nose due to allergies. So I would describe the coverage as sheer to light.
Regarding the color, I bought the ""ivory"". My skin tone is between fair and medium, and very neutral so foundations usually leave me looking orange or pink. The ivory matched my skin well, and the product did not oxidise and change color on me.
I paid about $18 CAD for a bottle, so it wasn't THAT expensive but given its performance, I wouldn't buy it again.
I would recommend this to people with oily skin because it is lightweight and not oily, and to people who want something to enhance their complexion rather than to help cover redness or ""spottiness"" from acne."

There is nothing in here that has anything to do with oxygen, but even so, oxygen causes free-radical damage, inside and outside our bodies, and that isn't a good thing—as cumulative free-radical damage is a leading causative factor of aging. The whole concept of using antioxidants is all about reducing the oxidative damage caused by oxygen and other types of free radicals.Oxygen technology claims aside, this long-wearing foundation has merit and is a good option for normal to oily skin. The cream concealer provides good coverage yet is fairly standard and does not offer the same antioxidant blend as the foundation. Also, the waxes and other creamy ingredients in this concealer aren't the best for use on breakouts.With over a dozen shades to choose from, there are matches for fair to dark skin tones, though some shades do tend to pull more peachy-red.

Currently, this is my everyday foundation because of budget limits. My skin is not nice, I have hyper pigmentation, wrinkles and many acne scars. I also have a VERY oily t-zone. This foundation cannot keep me oil free for even 3 hours. Because you don't Stay matte, I took a star off. That said it doesn't make me more oily than I am, which is nice. The foundation feels very light weight and gives medium coverage. It cannot be layered for more coverage. It is long wearing though, and it doesn't break down with average sweat or oiliness during the day. This foundation isn't HG for me because it doesn't help smooth my skin texture, or give me a matte radiance (unlike loreal' pro Matte which does, though that foundation is inferior to this one in many KEY respects). That said, this is unlikely to clog your pores, its water based, gives natural looking medium, matte coverage, doesn't separate under sweat and oil, its long wearing, unscented as far as I can tell, and affordable. This is a solid 4 stars out of 5. I would recommend this to any young people (under 30) with combination to oily skin looking for their first foundation, or anyone if they have an awesome primer/powder combo that smooths their skin already, or has smooth skin like Tati from Youtube. I apply this with a real techniques expert face brush and it blends in super easy. Im around NC 42-43 and the closest match is 15 Beige. If you were NC 44, 45 You could go with 19 Sand, that one is a bit too dark/orange on me but still workable."

That technique works well enough (though it’s messy), but unlike many loose mineral foundations, this one cannot provide full coverage without looking cakey. If you prefer sheer to light coverage and have normal to oily or combination skin, you’re in luck, but that assumes you don’t mind a soft shimmer finish. If you already have oily skin, you want to be cautious about adding extra shine. Of all the Extra Virgin foundations, this one has the most neutral shades that will suit the widest range of fair to tan skin tones.As for the mineral makeup angle, please see More Info below to learn why it’s more marketing angle than a beauty breakthrough. Also refer to More Info for what is a confusing discrepancy regarding the claim that this foundation provides sun protection.
Pros:

Finely milled powder has a light-as-air texture.
Wide range of neutral shades.
Natural-looking sheer to light coverage.
Fragrance-free.


Cons:

Screw-top sifter packaging is messy.
Soft shimmer finish not ideal for combination/oily skin, the skin types this powder foundation is best for.

More Info:Mineral Makeup

The “mineral” in the name of this product is merely a marketing ploy to lead consumers to believe that all things mineral are something special. Mineral makeup generally includes the same cosmetic ingredients that companies have been including in products for years. There is nothing more natural or preferred about makeup labeled mineral than other powders without that designation.Sun Protection Issue

This foundation includes the sunscreen ingredient titanium dioxide, which is capable of providing adequate sun protection, and it’s marked as “sunscreen” on The Body Shop’s website, but NOT on the product itself. Because the titanium dioxide is not designated as “active” on the label, and because there is no accompanying SPF rating, you should absolutely not rely on this product for sun protection.","Extra Virgin Minerals Powder Foundation","The Body Shop","",""

Don't believe it! It simply isn't possible. The formula for this foundation is quite dated—we haven't seen something like this since the 1980s were giving up the ""me decade"" ghost to the emerging trend of grunge music and flannel clothing! The fragranced formula has a fluid yet creamy texture with almost too much slip, so blending takes longer than it should. Coverage is sheer to medium, but can look spotty and choppy even if you blend carefully. Add to that a somewhat tacky finish that feels moist but looks chalky matte, and here is a foundation to leave on the shelf! The colors (which are only for light to medium skin tones) look more neutral in the tube than they do on skin.
Pros:

Inexpensive (and in this case you really do get what you pay for).


Cons:

Outdated formula cannot even come close to making good on its skin- and texture-matching claims.
Colors look more peachy or pink on skin than they do in the tube.

That’s because the ingredients necessary to create a rich, moisturizing texture tend to have an oxidizing effect on the pigments in the formula. That in turn means that the shade you applied in the morning may begin looking more orange or peach as the day goes on, especially if you have oily areas (such as on or near the nose).The other reasons are that the formulas tend to separate in the package and it’s tricky to blend powder-based products over a foundation with a notably moist finish. Creme Smooth Foundation appears to have avoided these pitfalls, but given that this is a new foundation, it takes time to see if the product will separate. This thick foundation is packaged in a large, heavy jar. Although Mercier added some antioxidants to the formula, the fact that it’s packaged in a jar means the beneficial ingredients won’t remain stable once it is opened. All plant extracts, vitamins, antioxidants, and other state-of-the-art ingredients break down in the presence of air, so once a jar is opened and lets the air in, these important ingredients begin to deteriorate. Jars also are unsanitary because you’re dipping your fingers into them with each use, adding bacteria, which further deteriorate the beneficial ingredients. 

Texture-wise, Smooth Creme Foundation leans toward the greasy side of creamy, and it has moderate slip during blending. You’ll find this sets to a satin matte finish that doesn’t mesh with skin as well as some of Mercier’s other foundations, at least not without diligent blending. Coverage goes from medium to full; in fact, even if you try to apply this makeup sheer, it’s difficult to get less than medium coverage. Not surprisingly, the formula is best for dry skin not prone to breakouts. The shade range is mostly excellent there are good options for light to dark (but not very dark) skin tones.

While the creamy consistency does feel moisturizing on dry skin, the finish emphasizes fine lines.Very little product is needed to get medium coverage, and it blends well. A major problem is that, like its sister product Flawless Beauty Fluid, there are only three color options, and only one of them (No. 1 Cream) appears natural on its intended skin tone. Plus, there's the matter of price—for this much, you should be able to get much better performance!One last comment: This cream foundation is rated SPF 28. The sun protection comes from titanium dioxide as the active ingredient (though Pixi doesn't list the percentage or follow the Drug Facts labeling standards required by U.S. cosmetics regulations (FDA), so be cautious in considering the rating). The other ingredients included on Pixi's ""active"" list (which is the same online and on the printed packaging for this product) do not provide sun protection. The fact that they're listed as ""active"" does not respond to FDA regulations; when we asked, the company had no explanation for the discrepancy!

													Foundation is moisturizing on dry skin.

More Info:
Inclusion of Known Irritants: Irritation, whether you see it on the surface of your skin or not, causes inflammation and as a result impairs healing, damages collagen, and depletes the vital substances your skin needs to stay young. For this reason, it is best to eliminate, or minimize as much as possible, your exposure to known skin irritants, especially when there are brilliant formulas available that do not include these types of problematic ingredients.Fragrance-free is the best way for all skin types to go for all skin types (Food and Chemical Toxicology, 2008 & American Journal of Clinical Dermatology, 2003)

The sneaky part about irritation is that research has demonstrated that you don't always need to see it or feel it for your skin to suffer damage, and that damage may remain hidden for a long time (Skin Pharmacology and Physiology, 2008).","Natural Performance Foundation","Lorac","",""

I have oily skin with bad acne scarring as well as new acne that comes up regularly. I have never noticed a product really breaking me out, my acne is hormonal and caused by stress, but this foundation has caused my oil problem to increase. Not only does the foundation slide off my face and start to break apart on my skin, even after washing it off my face just always feels extra oily. I had researched so many foundations and decided I wanted to try this one. The price of it was pretty low for a high-end brand and it was supposed to be full coverage. The coverage was no better than my Revlon Colorstay foundation, and that's really sad. Though the coverage can be built up, it gets cakey quickly. Also, the color selection is a joke. The lightest color seemed my color, but for someone who was peach undertones to my skin, it was too pinky. My arms are yellowish, but my neck/face are very peachy, making finding a good foundation very hard, but professionals have always matched me with pink. The lightest foundation is PINK! The next shade up is too dark for me, and though it is supposed to be beige, is very very orange/pink. I had read so many reviews, most of them having negative things to say, but I wanted to see for myself. Most of the time when people say a foundation is cakey, it is because they are not applying it with a moisturizer or with too much primer, but I tried this foundation so many times and always was unhappy with it. The more I try it, the more I hate it. I still love Kat Von D, but this foundation is not for me. Maybe people with normal skin will like it, but it does not like my oily skin at all."

A few years ago I watched Kim K do her daily makeup routine and she used literally a TON of moisturizer- like I thought ""no way"" - well, after almost sending this foundation back, I tried it that way and along with my PC primer it worked!
I'm 53 so my skin has changed and I was using heavier full coverage foundations and never thought I could go back to a lighter foundation- so happy I gave it a go Bc I feel a lot more natural and now that I figured out how to apply this (for me a good foundation brush rather than my beauty blender) and a touch up once a day around my eyes with my brush and a little moisturizer (Bc that's where it does tend to settle after a long day) and I'm still looking pretty good. 

Always wanted to try this foundation, but thought that at over 50 my skin was needing more coverage - so glad I proved myself wrong - 
Also, I tried like just about every foundation out there over the course of six months before landing on Hourglass (which I still love). But I always wanted that very light natural look and wanted to try Armani- 

I'm a 5, but could likely blend in a darker color to end up with the absolute ""perfect shade"", however I think it's just about right and now have zero complaints."

You’ll get medium to almost full coverage and the pigment technology behind this makeup, like many of today’s best foundations, allows the coverage to blur imperfections and improve skin tone without feeling or looking like a mask. On balance, the formula is best for normal to dry skin.The shade range covers light to medium-tan skin tones, but beware—some of the shades have a slight, typically unflattering orange-y, undertone. A bigger issue (and the reason for this foundation’s rating) is the inclusion of strong fragrance, which is not only noticeably annoying for your nose, but also irritating to your skin (see More Info).Pros:
Medium to almost full coverage for light to medium-tan skin tones. 
Improves skin tone without looking like a mask. 
Creamy, fluid texture blends on smoothly.
Cons:
 Noticeable fragrance is not only annoying, but also potentially irritating.
 Some of the shades have an unflattering, orange undertone.
More Info:Daily use of products that contain a high amount of fragrance, whether the fragrant ingredients are synthetic or natural, causes chronic irritation that can damage healthy collagen production, lead to or worsen dryness, and impair your skin’s ability to heal. Fragrance-free is the best way to go for all skin types. If fragrance in your skin-care products is important to you, it should be a very low amount to minimize the risk to your skin (Sources: Inflammation Research, December 2008, pages 558–563; Skin Pharmacology and Physiology, June 2008, pages 124–135, and November-December 2000, pages 358–371; Journal of Investigative Dermatology, April 2008, pages 15–19; Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology, March 2008, pages 78–82; Mechanisms of Ageing and Development, January 2007, pages 92–105; and British Journal of Dermatology, December 2005, pages S13–S22).","HD Studio Photogenic Foundation","NYX Cosmetics","",""

A few years ago I watched Kim K do her daily makeup routine and she used literally a TON of moisturizer- like I thought ""no way"" - well, after almost sending this foundation back, I tried it that way and along with my PC primer it worked!
I'm 53 so my skin has changed and I was using heavier full coverage foundations and never thought I could go back to a lighter foundation- so happy I gave it a go Bc I feel a lot more natural and now that I figured out how to apply this (for me a good foundation brush rather than my beauty blender) and a touch up once a day around my eyes with my brush and a little moisturizer (Bc that's where it does tend to settle after a long day) and I'm still looking pretty good. 

Always wanted to try this foundation, but thought that at over 50 my skin was needing more coverage - so glad I proved myself wrong - 
Also, I tried like just about every foundation out there over the course of six months before landing on Hourglass (which I still love). But I always wanted that very light natural look and wanted to try Armani- 

I'm a 5, but could likely blend in a darker color to end up with the absolute ""perfect shade"", however I think it's just about right and now have zero complaints."

And for oily or young skin, this might be a great fit! I also like several of this company's products. 

However, for this powder foundation, it just wasn't a good fit for me. I don't have oily skin. Nor young skin. A fair dusting for minimal coverage worked okay, but I ended up having to use a tinted sunscreen moisturizer as well, beforehand, and the powder acted more like a setting powder than a foundation (and gave a very matte finish, which works for oily skin, but not my dry skin). A heavier application for medium coverage made my skin look so heavy it seemed to sag. I looked older -- which is the last thing I wanted.

And transference was an issue, even with setting spray. 

In the end, I could not use this long enough to tell if it actually provided additional benefits to my skin from long-term use (as it claims). If I were in my 20s, or had oily skin (or both!) I think this could've worked well. However, for my mature prone-to-dryness skin, this simply couldn't work for me. 

In addition, I have very fair skin, but Porcelain made me look a bit dead. The next shade up was too dark (looked orange on me). Medium tones and beyond may be fine, but they need an in between shade for their light shades.

I chose No, I would not recommend this to a friend, because my friends are all over 40."

Its smooth, creamy texture blends on with fluid ease and offers medium to full coverage.The shade range is attractive and best for light (but not fair) to deep skin tones with normal to oily skin. Its matte finish is not the best for those with dry skin or dry patches, however, because it tends to magnify rather than downplay dry areas—a hallmark of most cream-to-powder foundations.One other thing to note: In general the ""oil-free"" part of this product's name is a meaningless claim because there are plenty of ingredients that don't sound like oils but can potentially aggravate breakouts. If you're prone to breakouts, lightweight liquid or powder foundations are your best bets.Pros:
  Cream-to-powder matte finish ideal for normal to oily skin.
  Medium-to-full coverage without looking heavy.
  Attractive shade range for light to deep skin tones.
Cons:
  Contains potentially irritating fragrance.
More Info: Daily use of products that contain a high amount of fragrance, whether the fragrant ingredients are synthetic or natural, causes chronic irritation that can damage healthy collagen production, lead to or worsen dryness, and impair your skin's ability to heal. Fragrance-free is the best way to go for all skin types.

A pleasant surprise!","This is a long review but well worth it! This is like a cross between Kevyn Aucoin's Sensual Skin Enhancer and Josie Maran Vibrancy Argan Foundation. I have very dry skin, often have dry patches, and I have very pale olive skin that is hard to match, sensitive and irritates easily and can break out with many producta- so needless to say it is hard to find foundations. This though works great! I use tge shade Shell (similar to Nars Gobi in color and Josie Maran Vibrancy G15 Cosmic). Instead of sucking the moisture out of my skin like most mattifying products, it actually held my natural moisture in while keeping my skin from looking/feeling a hot mess in this tropical rainforest like god awful humidity! It was a huge surprise that it did NOT cling to my dry patches, but instead smoothed them out! The coverage is in between the two - very close to completely full coverage but without being heavy- easy to make it totally full. The texture is much like JM- it feels very whipped, like a dense mousse. It dries very quickly like the description says- use your fingers or a large stippling or buffing brush. Normally I use my beauty blender for everything as i love how flawless and natural the finish is, but do not try it with this, and you don't need to use a BB with this anyway. The finish was very natural looking and feeling but I looked flawless! Even the hubs (a manly man mechanic) commented how flawless my skin looked! The only other products he has noticed and commented the positive difference on are Guerlain- so that should really tell you something about this product! This worked beautifully over all my primers, but i feel that any glow/light focused pre-foundation products get lost with this over it, because of it's very strong coverage. Even my HG ambient primer I felt got lost with this over it. So imo, save the glow products for post foundation application. Guerlain Meteorites pearls and pressed conpacts, and HG Ambient and Strobe powders are gorgeous over this."

Granted, the prices are enticing, but saving money in exchange for a so-so product isn't really a beauty bargain!Invincible Fullest Coverage Foundation has a fragrance-free formula that doesn't make good on its claim of ""fullest coverage"". Layer after layer, this still lets the imperfections we most want to hide show through, and the more you layer for extra coverage, the worse this feels. The finish is an odd mix of powdery and tacky and it tends to emphasize lines, pores, and the slightest hint of dry skin.On the plus side, this is relatively easy to blend and it's far from the thick, waxy feel common to many full coverage foundations (like Dermablend). However, this absolutely looks like makeup on skin and it rubs off easily, not to mention fades during wear time.Turning to the shades, they're a mixed bag. Within the range you'll find the following colors are noticeable pink to peach, and that's not good news given this foundation's other issues: Porcelain, Medium, Medium Beige, and Caramel. If you're willing to put up with this foundation's other issues and are sure to set this with a good powder so it wears better, the remaining shades offer some good options for fair to dark skin tones.			
			
							
					Pros:
					
													Fragrance-free.
											
				
			
							
					Cons:
					
													Does not provide the ""fullest coverage"".
