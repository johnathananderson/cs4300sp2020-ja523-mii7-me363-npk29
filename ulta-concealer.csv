I'm a real BB cream person as opposed to foundation. However.... I have this in the lightest shade and it works on my completion in the summer when I have a slight tan but is too dark and warm in the winter. It also does not cover acne well at all. It slightly will tone it down but literally won't even last for 30 minutes... And if I try to use a powder on top that doesn't really work either. Maybe this is better for under eyes but I like to use the bare minimum of makeup. Sucks, I really want to like these products because they are vegan and cruelty free.

I have normal skin that can lean more dry or combo depending on the weather. I find if I use this powder with a light hand it will help my makeup last all day and make my face look flawless. If I accidentally use too much though I find it can make my face look drying. If I do have texture or dryness on my face it will not sit well, but once my makeup warms to my skin temperature the textured areas do look much better. One thing I really like about this powder is it doesn't settle into fine lines or wrinkles like the Maybelline Loose Setting Powder does. I also enjoy that there is no scent. This powder provides some coverage. This powder does help control oil. If I were to compare it to the Maybelline Loose Setting Powder though, I think Maybelline does a slightly better job. I wouldn't mind purchasing this again but I think I would prefer to try a powder from Covergirl's line that provides some radiance. Since getting older I have realized matte products are a bit much for my skin since it only gets oily in the summer months. But since we are in summertime, this powder will be well used.","","4","Solid Face Powder",""

It does tend to settle into creases a bit under the eyes, but I have this problem with every single concealer I use due to my eye shape. I also like the medium coverage it offers as I'm more into the natural look. I wouldn't recommend this for covering up super prominent blemishes, as it doesn't really have enough coverage for that, but it's great if you have a few spots of pigmentation/acne scarring  you want to cover/conceal while still keeping your skin looking like skin (ticking all boxes for me!).

Different kinds of products. I have had products that I don't love, but can still work with. This is NOT one of those products. This is supposed to be concealer. It is blindingly pale even on my light skin. The most unnatural look I've seen. The worst part is that it is so so cakey. It makes me look like I have weird spots and wrinkles on my eyes that aren't even there. I apply it with a high quality brush, and within seconds it looks awful. I try to fix it with a beauty blender and it only looks worse. I don't have wrinkles and this product makes my skin look like garbage. I am questioning how this even has so many good reviews. I wouldn't recommend it and I am throwing it right in the trash. It is not useable .","","1","Cakes, settles in lines, makes skin look crepey",""

It is very pigmented and I use a concealer brush to spread it around and tap it into my fine lines. I have light to medium colored skin and bought the light/medium concealer, which is much lighter than my skin, so I use my foundation over it. It really gives a nice youthful look when I'm all finished with my makeup application. The Hey Honey concealer really seems to firm up and conceal my under eye area. And at the rate that I'm using the product (just a tiny amount each day), it will last me forever!

This is VERY specific type of concealer, the closest thing I can think to compare it to is the Glossier stretch concealer, because it's very emollient and has light to medium (if you build it up) coverage. Anyone who says this concealer is cakey or full coverage is 100% applying it too heavily, you should Not draw it on in thick lines (as tempting as that can be), and I find it easiest to blend under the eyes with a fingertip, but it works just as well with a brush.

This concealer is for someone like me; very dry skin, only requires light to medium coverage under the eyes, looking for a non-drying dewy-to-satinish finish. If you're not that specific consumer you may not like it, so be aware.

TLDR; if you're looking for an affordable almost-dupe of Glossier stretch concealer and you fit into this shade range, you've come to the right place.

P.S. This shade range is a joke, Covergirl, get it together.","","5","10/10 would recommend",""

Overall, it is a little more expensive than I would normally prefer but I appreciate the formula and the coverage so I'm willing to splurge, especially because I have sensitive skin! If you're on edge, I would say to do it! I bought it at a different store because it was on sale about six months ago and haven't looked back!","","5","Great for Darkness",""

This is VERY specific type of concealer, the closest thing I can think to compare it to is the Glossier stretch concealer, because it's very emollient and has light to medium (if you build it up) coverage. Anyone who says this concealer is cakey or full coverage is 100% applying it too heavily, you should Not draw it on in thick lines (as tempting as that can be), and I find it easiest to blend under the eyes with a fingertip, but it works just as well with a brush.

This concealer is for someone like me; very dry skin, only requires light to medium coverage under the eyes, looking for a non-drying dewy-to-satinish finish. If you're not that specific consumer you may not like it, so be aware.

TLDR; if you're looking for an affordable almost-dupe of Glossier stretch concealer, you've come to the right place.

P.S. This shade range is a joke Covergirl, get it together.","","5","10/10 would recommend",""

There isn't a way for me to physically blend it at all, because it just slides off and removed anything and everything underneath. I tried instead using it underneath my foundation to cover up blemishes and start with a more even base and brightened under-eyes. The problem there is that as I apply my foundation, all of the concealer rubs right off. I can't find a way to actually use this product successfully, so the fact that the shades are perfect is rendered totally useless. It's difficult to apply in the first place because it's almost hard, it isn't creamy or smooth at all and it pulls on my skin as I try to apply it. I don't know what on Earth that hard little nub brush is supposed to accomplish, but it streaks the product off of the skin with no resemblance to blending.

Now I have dark circles and a few fine lines under my eyes. In the past 15 years so many new concealers have come out, and I've tried so many of them, and returned so many of them. Boing is just the best, hands down.  If it's a 'run errands' kind of day, I use the regular Boing concealer. For a night out or whenever i need to look my best, it's Industrial Strength Boing. It covers EVERYTHING,  it doesn't crease. You don't have to tug at your eye to apply it. It stays where you put it.  It doesn't oxidize and change color.  It actually feels good on your eye area.  You can layer this and it won't cake up.  It's just the perfect concealer. It also pairs perfectly with Benefit's Erase Paste and Lemonade without looking cakey or overly made up.

I know Benefit is known for their line of brow products, which are all wonderful, but they really should spend some time advertising their concealers because they're amazing.","","5","Wish I could give 10 stars!!",""

I use my clean ring finger to gently pat and blend the color in, extending it to the tops of my cheekbones and even the inner corners of my eyes.

After doing my normal skin routine, I did my brows and used this to perfect them.... however. It didn't like blend? It seemed kind of flaky and my skin was very moisturized. For me, it just didn't blend well or do me justice. So, I gave it to my mom. She's very tan, and I used this under her eyes & baked it... Wow it looked amazing on her. Her under eyes were white as snow and she looked 20 years younger. She wore it out and while doing yard work outside in 80 degree weather. Still no creasing at the end of the day. So for her, it worked 5/5. For me, 1/5 because it didn't work for my fair, dry skin. It was a waste of money for myself, but I'm glad my mom enjoys it. Instead, I ordered concealer from KKW with the baking and brightening powder. I wish I could give a higher review because I love Kylie Cosmetics products.

Please do NOT DISCONTINUE or change formula!  It is PERFECT.

I ordered three different samples and this really helped me figure out what looks best on my skintone.  I am not extremely fair, but I'm not a medium.  Now that I have the correct color, all my other makeup looks SO MUCH BETTER.  I have light skin with pink undertones and a little peach.  I thought I was neutral but neutral has too much yellow for me.   Please do not discontinue this color because I will be back again and again to reorder.  I have tried so many different concealers colors and brands trying to figure out the correct shade and consistency. Other brands that conceal well are very thick and not smooth enough.  The consistency is perfect and did not fall into my creases.   

The pink undertone is very necessary for me because I have dark circles and a small dark blue vein around one of my eyes.  I have had this since I was very young and my skin is very transparent in color around my eyes.  I was shocked at how well it covered my imperfections without looking like I actually had makeup on.  I also did not even have add a pink base concealer with it.  I frequently have problems with concealing this blue vein with other expensive brands and believe me, you name it, I've tried it.  With the correct shade and undertone of pink, I was able to mask the dark circle and vein flawlessly with minimal primer. I do always use an eye cream though.

 I use the IT cosmetics concealer brush and you have to use very little of this product for it to go a long way.   I will definitely be reordering in a larger size now that I figured out my shade.  I can use the other sample colors on other areas of my face and blend it in with my concealer without a problem.  Now that I have my concealer correct, I will probably be back to correct my foundation shade as well.","","5","I plan to reorder the larger size.  LIGHT w/PINK UNDERTONES",""

The only thing that makes this go away is drowning my face in Mac fix +, but that's not worth it for such a cheap concealer. I've also tried applying different amounts like just dotting it over my face and swiping it like other concealers but it looks terrible either way. A little goes a long way and i think it actually blends out better with a brush than with a beauty blended. I have super dry, flakey skin and this concealer honestly makes it look so much worse.

There's a little more creasing than I'd expect from such a dry formula, and when I set it with my beloved Aquasurance powder foundation (or any other powder I've tried), I get bunching. Normal eye moisture causes this concealer to break up, so it's not waterproof at all. It took a lot of work to make it look smooth around my eyes. It's also extremely light in color. I bought a shade that's 2 shades deeper than what I'd usually select, and it's still a little too light (see photo).

Another review said to let it sit for a bit before blending so it can be built up so I will give that a try. This is very similar to Glossier's skin tint in its sheerness and consistency if that helps. Definitely pass if you are looking for a thick or medium to full coverage concealer, but if you are just looking for some brightness try it out.","","3","not happy, not mad",""

First thing you should know, this is not a full coverage concealer & if that's what you're looking for, then there are plenty of them out there & this brand offers a couple of them too. So giving this a poor review bcz of that really isn't fair bcz it's not marketed to be one. But if you're looking for something that has a light to medium buildable coverage, blends out super easily (too easy??), brightens in a snap, then this might work for you. This is not for covering major dark circles or erasing discolorations or scars, etc. This is for light covering while simultaneously brightening. It will help conceal slight veins on the lids or brightening under the eyes or high points of the face but it's not meant to compete with a high coverage foundation. It might be good for spot concealing if you can find your exact shade match. I normally don't use an under eye concealer because it's just too noticeable on me but this is something that I've come to like because it brightens nicely without it looking like I have too much makeup on. I feel like if I want something to stand out on my face, I definitely don't want it to be my concealer. I'll save the focal point for eyeshadow or a bright lip. This would be fantastic too for those who gravitate towards a no makeup look.  I've also used this to prime my lids & it's nice for that but only if I'm doing a more natural eye look. Otherwise I use a heavier eye base or primer. The formula is light but not dry like many having thus consistency. It doesn't have that major dry down like the maybelline age rewind or elf camo. But it also doesn't erase and cover like those do either. This is different than those.","","4","Different from what I was expecting",""

This concealer has a weird consistency (very hard, kind of waxy, like a waxy lip balm), but when you rub your finger (or brush) on it, it's immediately usable and a couple of swirls gives you more than enough product to begin applying. With the amount I use for my under-eye-area and the occasional blemish or red spot, this little pot will last FOREVER. I've had no breakouts or irritation and the BUFF color (second to lightest) is a perfect match for my skin tone. It's super easy to apply whether with a finger or a brush and I've found that it lasts all day. If you need heavier coverups, you might need to apply several layers and or set it to get the same lasting power.","","5","Great Product",""

It is a little sticky (similar to lip gloss as other reviewers noted), but that didn't bother me.  It takes a good bit of work this get this blended, but once done, the result is praiseworthy. I was pleased with the coverage. However, within a few hours, the results took a turn for the worse. The coverage became very patchy and caked on my skin.  I've never had this happen with other concealers.  It was very noticeable and a complete fail. I live in south Georgia where it is very hot and humid.

It is a very dense foundation and tugs horribly on your skin if you are to apply it straight from the tube. I suggest using a sponge or Blendiful to get the product out of the tube and then applying to face. 
Once on your face there is very little coverage. And it is heavy.

You can see the images, I don't think that there is a difference between the picture of me with no concealer and then the picture of me with 2 layers of concealer.  I thought the product itself was a bit greasy and made my under eye area look shiny and drew more attention to it.  The other side of the tube called ""cover"" did little to hide any blemishes or discolored skin I applied it to.

I was waffling between the ivory and the almond, and only almond was available, so.... Works fine.  Gives a nice light look.  Hides the look of the darker circle, but doesn't layer on anything heavy.  LOOKS VERY NATURAL like you are not wearing makeup but just don't have circles under your eyes.  If you wear full coverage foundation and like that look, this product will not give that to you.  If  you want a quick concealer that makes you look better and does not disclose it's presence, this is PERFECT.  Glad I tried it.","","5","Solution for cakey visible concealer",""

It's a solid small pot of long-lasting pigment (I use NC42) and it lasts for ages. Compact enough to slip into any bag or purse, with an SPF of 35 which means if I've concealed a blemish left behind after a breakout, there's no way any UV rays are going to darken those marks! I don't use this for large areas as I find it looks slightly orange-y on me (yet I cannot find another shade that blends in so well when using on just a tiny area, weird huh?). What I do is apply with the tiniest brush possible, such as MAC's Synthetic Pointed Liner brush, directly onto any minor blemish in a dabbing motion, and within seconds it's as though it was never there! I'm one of those people who hardly ever touch my face at all (good job, considering...) but I guess for those that do you would need to use a setting powder as this will not stay on otherwise. One very slight issue I've had has been the transparent plastic lid caving in. Previously I've been able to push it until it clicks back in place, but on my most recent pot this hasn't been possible and it refuses to stay put. Not the biggest of problems but would be better if more sturdy. Otherwise I cannot fault this and will continue to use for as long as it's around. -> My 'Ulta Beauty Top 7 must-have list' (thought it might be useful to share my 7 favorite beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Ulta) < - < 1.

There's a lot of shades along with some great correctors too! I chose the pink one bcz I have several concealers that I like the consistency & formula of but the undertone is off. For example, I have a VERY cool undertone to my skin, but I'm not overly fair or light so it's difficult for me to find foundations & concealers that are in the light to light-medium - medium range while still having a VERY pink undertone. You see when a warm-toned person puts on a foundation or concealer that's too pink, it's automatically called ""cool toned"", so then someone who has a cool undertone tries on this same concealer or foundation, it's still incredibly yellow or orangey looking on me. So companies are oftentimes testing their shades on people who's skin isn't pink enough to begin with & it's the very reason why the products that are labeled as being ""cool toned"" really aren't - they just look too cool toned up against a warm or yellow undertone. These brands NEED to test their shades on people that already have that truly cool undertone in order to be able to offer shades that will actually match s1 like me. It's so rare I find a true shade match & it's even more rare to find a concealer or foundation that's in the light-medium range & still maintain a TRUE cool/pink undertone. So I bought this pink corrector to add in to my concealers. I buy them deep enough & add in this pink corrector & it lightens the shade while cooling off the undertone so it's more  pink and thus a match for me. It's the only way Im able to obtain a match for my semi-unusual skin color. I'm tired of having to ""make things work"" but this isn't too bad bcz it has a really beautiful smooth, creamy, hydrating formula that isn't too hydrating/drying & nice pigmentation. They don't have my perfect shade, but by adding a pink corrector to a deeper shade, I can get a match and a great formula!","","4","I see why people have liked this for so many years",""

I got the lightest shade to use for cut creases on my eye shadow because I didn't want to keep using my regular concealer & I'm really disappointed with this one. Barely any product comes out on the applicator which is frustrating, because I have to keep dipping it back in several times to get the tiniest amount out as I'm trying to do a cut crease & it's frustrating. It also smells really weird and chemically, which I'm not a fan of. Lastly I had a situation where it literally clumped up and like took my makeup off of my eye lid? Im not sure if this was an issue with the eyeshadow palette I was using, or something else, but I was using Jeffree Star Cosmetics Jawbreaker in shade 'Snack' and I've never had any issues with any of his palettes so I doubt it was because of the shade. I've only used it twice , first time it wasn't terrible to use. I think maybe what happened to me with it clumping off is it wasnt dry enough before going in with the shadow. So I wont completely knock it for something that was maybe my fault. But over all I still don't like how thick and tacky it is, and how strong and paint like the smell is & definitely dislike the amount of times I have to reach back into the bottle to get anything to come out.","","2","Invest in something better",""

If you love that product I think you'll also love this concealer because it pairs really seamlessly with it.  I have blue veins that peek through my under eye area.  I want to cover them but I don't want to slather on concealer that will that cake up, crease, and draw attention to the texture of the skin in my under eye area.  I've been on the hunt for a hydrating, non-irritating concealer that won't make my under eyes look worse than if I had not used anything.  I've tried: Urban Decay, Bare Minerals, Becca, ELF, NYX, Maybelline, W3LL People, and Pacifica.  While I had some measure of success with some of those I tried, I just wasn't completely satisfied with the results. Since Cover Girl announced they were going cruelty-free, I decided to take another look at their product line and give this product a try and I'm SO glad that I did.  I don't apply it like lipstick, instead, I run my ring finger on to the concealer stick to warm up the product and pick it up on my finger, and then I dab my finger under my eye.  After I've finished dabbing the product I then lightly blend with my Beauty Blender.  I gives me coverage without looking heavy, it just looks like my skin, and doesn't become a mess by the end of the day.  It pairs well with the CG Smoothers BB cream when I want a no-makeup look day and it pairs well with my foundation too, but if you're going for heavier coverage foundation then this might not be a heavy enough coverage concealer to pair with.","","5","It's 2020 and I'm just discovering this gem!",""

Now ordering my 3rd pot. I have a medium, olive skin tone. I've always struggled with combination skin, with plenty of oil in my t-zone. Finding a good concealer had been disappointment after disappointment. Either the color, the texture, consistency, staying power or something was always less than desirable. I'm an IT cosmetics girl for my foundation and setting power, as well as some various other IT products. I was in my local store one day, and a consultant that always can tell when I'm having an internal debate. I have a now 1 year old, and at that time she was only 4-5 months old. Sleep was more difficult to come by. Not to mention the days were insanely busy when I returned to work after maternity leave. I explained to her that I needed a good concealer. One that wasn't too slick, didn't have 100 colors to choose from (options are great, I just get overwhelmed when there's too many). I needed it to last all day, blend easy and bit cake or settle in my creases or in the oil my skin surely would produce every single day. The first time I used this, I was a little skeptical. It was hard and not super malleable. It didn't seem to spread like I hoped and had a gritty texture. I used too much then and found it hard to blend. So I learned and kept trying. I would say it took me about a week to find the best application for me. I lightly swirl my finger a couple of times and begin applying by patting onto my eyelids, under eye, nose (redness), and into any areas that I blemishes or discoloration. It warms in your finger, the trick for me is lightly applying. Rubbing it can pull on the skin. After gently putting it on, I use my fingers to gently pat it in. Then use a damp beauty blender to give it a perfect finish. It does away with any discoloration and makes my complexion look beautiful. The creamy texture also perfectly fills pores and other imperfections you wish to hide. My biggest piece of advice is to remember a little goes a long way. If you use too much of this, it will look cakey, it will settle into fine lines. If it's too heavy it can't work right. That's no fault of the product itself. So while your first few tries may be somewhat frustrating, I promise if you just have a little patience and experiment with your technique and coverage needs, you'll begin to love it. Of course it's not for everyone, but for me it's been exactly what I've needed for many years. I can easily wear it to blend my complexion on days I don't want to wear makeup, too. I think my husband is even a little jealous that he doesn't have this for his under eye circles! Lol.","","5","Hands down my favorite concealer!",""

But a few more swirls softened it up, & no issues thereafter. Then I got an e.l.f. eyeshadow brush, the white handle one, and it works just fine as well (more precise application too lol). The bristles on this brush are fairly stiff, that may have something to do with it? A lot of these reviews are older, it's possible NYX changed the formula. Whatever the case, I love this stuff. It's an essential step in my routine. I can color correct atop my foundation with minimal concealer required to blend in the colors.

This has amazing staying power and the best part is that it blurs and does not feel heavy or look creased or cake-y at all! I made it a permanent in my makeup bag!","","5","You NEED this! Definite yes.",""

I have this concealer in 325, 340, and 365, and it's the same with them all. I even bought each at different times, so there's no way this is a batch issue. It's an ingredient, or mix of ingredients.

HOWEVER, on the face, there is no smell. It's very creamy and nice to work with. It blends out with a sponge and a brush. It will give you beautiful FULL coverage. I set it with translucent powder and the finish is a gorgeous natural matte. ...I'm not sure what ingredient is causing the product to smell. For that reason, i'd be selective with how often you use the product. But when I do use it, it's wonderful.","","5","Top-tier high coverage concealer",""

I've bout this product before and liked the coverage but never used it as a eyeshadow primer. With everything going on my budget has been tight so I decided to go back to NYX for the time being.

Eyeshadow Primer - It works awesome! Went on great, helped the shadow stay smooth, and didn't settle in the creases of my lid over time.  My eyeshadow looked fresh after hours.

Concealer- Coverage has always done a great job. I'm a mom with dark circles at times and it definitely brightens my eyes. Again, doesn't settle in the creases of the skin after a few hours.

Overall this product is a great bang for your buck without sacrificing anything.  Won't be buying Tarte Shape Tape again.","","5","Same as Tarte Shape Tape...Yes, I said it",""

It's my new go-to foundation for face and body. Covers up dark eye circles, acne, and freckles on my arms amazingly. Matches my skin tone, amazing coverage and pigmentation. It's hard enough to find a foundation for porcelain skin, even harder to find a quality one that actually covers and doesn't oxidize. I was woefully disappointed by Two Faced full coverage foundation in Cloud after it matched me but didn't cover well at all and left my skin feeling wet. As long as you blend well and set, this won't crease, as with most foundations, but heavier applications in places such as under the eyes may crease.
This makeup is definitely heavy in pigmentation, but also in weight and feel. Great for oily/combination skin but dry skin or light makeup users might not enjoy. Be careful what powders you use or it may turn color, but an otherwise fantastic product I will buy again and again.","","5","Amazing Full Coverage Makeup for Pale Skin!",""

This product is amazing. If I could give it 1000 stars, I most certainly would! It's so full coverage. I love the concealer+foundation mix. It's perfect. Doesn't leave any streaking, lasts FOREVER because it doesn't take much to get that coverage, definitely lives up to all of its claims, there are so many different color options, it's buildable, there are so many great things about this product! I usually use a cheaper foundation if I'm just running a couple quick errands and use this for work, going out, etc. When I use my cheaper foundation.. I use this one for my concealer! Which is awesome! There's just toooo many good things to say about it. It's definitely worth the price. Ladies, if you haven't given this a try.. DO SO NOW! 😍","","5","LOVE. LOVE. ABSOLUTELY.

It gives a natural and long lasting affect and does not accentuate my fine lines that come with age, I am over 50 and this has helped my under eyes look more youthful. It is not heavy or cakey and is easy to layer when a little more coverage is needed. I am a NW20 and use the color vanilla 010 which is a little peach toned, I also have sand 022 and is a little an the yellow side. I own around 15 other concealers both high end and drugstore and this is the best for me so far.
