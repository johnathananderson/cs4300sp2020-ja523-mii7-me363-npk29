I have been trying to transition for a bit and this is my new favorite foundation. For me, if I pair this with the CC cream underneath, it helps keep my skin moisturized. At first, the foundation seems hard to blend with a sponge. However, I talked to a JB vendor and she said the best way to get the most out of a pump is by placing on back of hand and moving in circular motions. Then with clean hands place a little of the foundation on face and blend with a sponge. That process has been working wonderfully and it gives great coverage. So happy I found this foundation. Also, if you have drier skin, or just want to add more to it, you can put one or two drops of a serum like hyaluronic acid or vitamin C. This helps to blend the foundation too. Girls, take the steps to go more organic and natural with your makeup and skincare. 
You won't regret it.","","5","Amazing",""

I feel like my skin can't breathe so in the past couple years I started using powder foundation. I don't have any wrinkles or acne to cover but I do have a few dark spots from acne years ago that this covers completely. I have very neutral undertones to my skin and most foundation looks pink on me. This doesn't. It matches extremely well. I was using BareMinerals powder foundation before this and it made my face look really white even though it was my supposed shade. I love the natural glow to it and how my skin can breathe with it on. I only have a couple minor complaints. It comes off the end of my nose after a couple hours but it could be from rubbing my nose due to allergies. With it being luminous, it accentuates my larger pores on my cheeks. I have bought the Celebration Foundation in the matte form and use it on my nose and cheeks and use this everywhere else. Problem has been solved. It's twice as expensive but they last twice as long. I will and have repurchased. Definitely recommend if you like powder foundation.","","5","Love the coverage",""

It oxidized and the shade range is pretty bad since I'm pretty pale. However, it was lightweight and made my skin look awesome! It didn't sink into my pores and didn't enhance dryness or anything. However, the worst part: acne. Not even wearing it for about 2 hours, I had put some on my chin to see if I liked it, and it was left on for around 2 hours before I took it off.

I needed a new bottle so I came online and at first I was surprised to even read that the formula had changed. I was disappointed but still held some hope that maybe the new formula wasn't as bad as people were saying. Welp... they were right. It's awful. My undertone is warm and this new formula is ORANGE (see picture). It doesn't even seem to have that dewy finish. Everything that was fantastic about this foundation is now gone. Not to mention the price is now higher. This foundation is garbage. I am returning it and finding something comparable, I have heard good things about Diorskin so maybe I'll try that. Lancome WHY OH WHY would you go and ruin the most perfect foundation there ever was? Blows my mind.","","1","Lancome has lost another long-term customer",""

Since it is a loose powder you can't just throw it on top of anything. Use a concealer first that dries down and make sure any primer or moisturizer is totally dry before you use this. I really think no primer is best. and I use a flat dense brush to really buff it in. My favorite is the Sigma F80. If your face is damp anywhere, even just if you are wearing lip balm, this will stick to that moisture and not bled out. You have to buff it in so you will have to buff over your lip line to make it seamless. Just leave your skin void of anything except a concealer that dries down and has already dried. 

Other than that this is luminous and truly blends into my skin to look like skin. The finish is one of the best I own! But if you just slap it on like any powder, or treat it like a regular foundation, you'll hate it.","","4","my favorite powder foundation",""

I tried it on its own and I found the product to be extremely dry for a liquid foundation. I usually go for a light weight foundation because I like the dewy look. The instructions say to use 4 drops for full-face coverage. Well, I had to use 8 drops to even get the product all over my face. I stashed the product in a drawer and completely forgot about it. That is until 1 month ago when I found it again and decided to give it another go. This time, I decided to mix it with a serum. I've been using ever since and I love the results. I use just a few drops of the foundation it's equal amounts of serum for a dewy look that lasts all day. 
Giving it 4 starts because I feel like you can really only wear if mixing with another product.","","4","Good overall",""

Every now and then, just to be different, I will use something else, but by a few hours later, I know why I always go back to Becca.  It just doesn't budge.  It covers everything beautifully and makes your skin looks absolutly flawless!  And it covers so well you don't even need a separate concealer - unless it's a lighter shade of this same foundation, which is exactly what I use - Buttercup as my base, and Vanilla around my eyes as my concealer.  Use a good moisturizer (I love Olay in the pink bottle) and primer (Becca or Physicians Formula highligher primer) and that is it!

It contains brightening ingredients such as Grapefruit extract, which is why when I wash this off, I swear my skin looks brighter than it did before I put it on! I stopped by at the Clinique counter to find the right match (the SA settled on two shades for me to trial: Oat and Honeywheat, neither of which were quite the right shade for me - 'Tea' was). As a light, non-oily, everyday foundation it works really well, coverage was medium but buildable and without using a primer beforehand, only setting powder after, it stayed put from 8AM in the morning until 5.30PM when I got in from work which is pretty good going. One of the downsides is that on oilier areas like my t-zone, especially on hotter days, it didn't last as long as it did on other areas, my pores becoming fairly visible after several hours, but that's an issue I find with many foundations, not just this one. Also the SPF 15 isn't quite as high as I'd like so I end up applying a sunblock separately before this. It's only the inclusion of sillicones that've prevented me from giving it a full 5 lippies, as I wouldn't be able to use everyday due to the breakout they cause me, otherwise a somewhat unique foundation that goes above and beyond just providing coverage. Good color match too! -> My 'Ulta Beauty Top 7 must-have list' (thought it might be useful to share my 7 favorite beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Ulta) < - < 1.

A little TMI, but it's hard to find reviews with my specific skin issues!
First off- I have an explanon in my arm (form of birth control). When I was between 18-22, I seriously had great skin with this in, after getting it replaced.... I've had to COMPLETELY revamp my skin routine. (26 now) It's hard to find a balance with foundation products and moisturizers that keep me from breaking out and this product has been a life-saver. Because of the excess oil my skin produces, everything needs to be water based, oil free and non-comedogenic. Although it's not great to have very oily skin, you CANNOT dry it out or else you go back in the reverse direction. Seriously a hard line that you have to teeter on! This product has made me feel confident in my skin by reducing the look of dark spots and uneven skin-tone and gives you that no make-up look that makes you have that 'beautiful-in-your-own skin' kind of feeling! Side note** I wear the dr. Brant pore reducing mattifying primer or the benefit pore primer underneath and my breakouts have reduced significantly! You can wear a little foundation over this if you want that flawless look but it is honestly great without it. (I'd recommend Estée Lauder non-comedogenic). Absolutely feels lightweight even with the added foundation!

For any of you with any similar skin issues- I definitely have tips and tricks if you don't want to go through the years of trial and error that it took for me! Yes, the costs of everything can get you worried, but this is the best my skin has looked and felt in years!","","5","Those with ""Unique"" skin-types",""

i normally am a person who likes a medium to full coverage however i like to switch it up periodically and try something new or perhaps a lighter formula. i am also used to using bb creams as a foundation alone so sheer doesnt bother me. 
to begin this is a sheer to med coverage. i think of it as a dewy type BUT it applies like cream to powder. it does not exactly dry down completely. it stays sheer but kinda sets in place. if u were to rub your face thruout the day it will transfer. i might add i did not wear a primer, powder or setting spray. i wore it alone with cream blush on top. i have combo skin. i used a toner after a clean face then essence as moisturizer then stick directly and blended with finger tips. after 4 hours it didnt move but nothing touched my face. if u have oily skin this may not be for you. this product did not appear patchy. it glided accross my skin. the color payoff is great i bought lt-med neutral bec that is my true skintone and it matched. again this product may transfer if u touch your face but i was working thruout the day and foundation didnt move exvept for my nose i can see oil coming thru but took a good 5 or more hours to see this. i will continue to use this and may purchase again. i did enjoy this product more than i realized. i also bought cream blush, liquid lipstick, shiny lipstick and the youthful glow concealer all by ulta. i felt that the foundation stick had more coverage than the youthful glow concealer for reference","","5","pleasantly surprised!",""

I knew that I wanted a matte foundation as to not accentuate old acne scars.  At first I was confused when I tried the foundation, because it didn't seem very matte.  I think the name, beyond matte might be a little misleading.  However, when I looked online at the description, it does state that its semi-matte.  So, I should've looked at that closer.  I figured that I would need to send it back, but to my suprise it covered my imperfections and didn't accentuate them.  So,  I was very pleased with that.

My face is on the dryer side but I also break out easily so I'm super picky about my foundation. This goes on matte but doesn't dry me out or look bad. I really like how I can build it to full coverage. I've waited a week to write a review because I wanted to see how it worked out. I've used a brush, wet beauty blender and my fingers to apply it. My favorite way is fingers and beauty blender. When I want my pores to disappear and get fuller coverage I put a very light layer on with my fingers then use more with a wet beauty blender on top. I use my heavier night cream on under this with just a little primer on my nose and between my eyebrows. This makeup really does last all day. It looks just as good at 10 hours as it does when I first put it on. I bought 2N2 Buff and love the color. I'm light/ light medium skin color. This gives a beautiful healthy glow.

I now have desert dry skin and I've been desperately trying to combat this with a complete change in skincare/makeup. This is probably the 5th attempt at foundation. I loved the coverage level. For me, it's as much as I want. Covers my redness and light blemishes while providing a seemingly nice canvas. Ordering by online shade swatches was beyond wacky though. DEFINITELY do this in-store (once Ulta re-opens😢) I've never had such difficulty trying to find a shade match. I'm your basic light/neutral and on my 5th shade it was finally decent. So day #1. Applied with zero primer. Just wanted to see the product work for itself. Applied beautifully. Within a few hours it settled into lines I never knew existed. I looked like I applied a crackly face mask. Full of separation as well. Horrifying. Next I purchased the Laura mercier hydrating primer. I really wanted this to work. It honestly helped tremendously. Better application, more natural finish and minimal separation. Can't say I'd purchase this again because it still isn't perfect, but totally okay with using it until it empties. Here's why I'm really deducting stars... I have been lucky and have had very few blemishes lately, but noticed after wearing this regularly for a week, I've developed intense blackheads. In places I've never in my life had them. Never experienced this ever with any makeup. This was the only addition to my routine so i really can't blame anything else. Another thing... how is NOBODY talking about the fragrance?!? It hit me immediately, and I tried around 5 different shades so I know I'm not crazy!! It's some really odd spicy scent?!!! What is that about?!!

I purchased this on a whim at the end of last year because it was on sale. I don't normally wear foundation every day (liquid ones are usually too heavy and take too much time in the mornings) and wanted something that would be light, easy to apply, and would sit well with my very oily skin. It's spring now and after multiple uses I can honestly say I love this foundation. It applies on powdery and then melts in nicely with my skin and gives a skin like finish. I have not experienced any caking so far. I also apply my Laura Mercier setting powder under my eyes and t zone areas to help control oil.

Page","https://www.ulta.com/makeup-face-foundation?N=26y5&No=96&Nrpp=96","I absolutely love this foundation. I used Urban Decay's Naked Skin for a long time until they changed the formula and it was really hard to find a new foundation that works for me. I have pale skin with extreme pink undertones and most foundations are just too neutral or yellow toned to work for me. Not this one! It goes on perfectly and I don't have to worry about it looking unnatural on my skin! It covers my rosacea and helps me feel confident again. All I need is 1-2 squirts of product and it spreads all over my face! It's also not super matte, so it dries, but doesn't look cakey. Gives me a nice, glowing look. 

I only have a one real con (hence the 4 star instead of 5 star rating): The price. This foundation is really expensive especially for how little is in the bottle. I'm having to replace foundations once every 2-3 months, when I used to be able to go at least 4-ish months with my older foundations.The squirt bottle is great, but once you start running low, it becomes very difficult to actually get the product out and you have to start rolling it up (like a toothpaste bottle). I wish there were an easier way to remove the top so that you could get the rest of the product out. For the price, I would expect this to last a little longer. My only other con is that if your skin is dry, it clings to the dry patches. I have rosacea on my face so I suffer from a lot of cheek dryness and texture patches and if I'm having a flare up, this foundation just clings to it and makes it more obvious.","","4","Love this foundation!",""

Page","https://www.ulta.com/makeup-face-foundation?N=26y5&No=96&Nrpp=96","This first thing I HAVE to say about this foundation is I LOVE the way it wears through out the day. It doesn't just ""come off"" in areas, like around the mouth & nose, but more like ""absorbs away"". After several hours(6hrs+) my foundation still look great, skin tone evened out. But it's at this point when it starts to ""fade"". It's a very gradual fade, kind of like when you start to lose your summer tan, it fades evenly. Even after 14hrs I STILL have tone evening coverage without patches. This stuff has changed my game, as I was starting to get absolutely sick of trying different foundations to get that truly natural looking finish that doesn't have ""shimmer"" or specks of ""glimmer/glitter"" like so many dewy type foundations have. Foundations I looked at where either really good for the first hour, but then dried out after an hour or two, or felt super heavy & then settled harshly into my wrinkles and lines... This stuff is neither. It has a watery like consistency that floats on to skin & blends so easily it's like watching magic happen! Let's face it, almost ALL foundations settle into wrinkles, it WILL happen. The difference between foundations is how easily it can be corrected and how many times you'll have to correct it before it stays in its permanent spot, if at all. After allowing it dry down for about 20 minutes there might be a couple areas that have slight settling, this is sooo easy to fix with just the touch/press of a finger. Areas like the forehead with lines/wrinkles just lightly press in (once you learn your problem areas it helps to do this from the beginning). If you have settling under the eye, gently swipe your finger downwards (opposite direction in which the line runs). After you've corrected the settled areas, most with a hydrating setting spray. This enhances the natural/ slightly dewy finish. If you have oily skin, this really isn't for you and I don't recommend ruining the gorgeous natural finish this foundation has by putting powder over it","","5","Dry skin? THIS. IS. YOUR. HOLY.

Throughout the day it loses the matte effect and then is a little bit oily. The foundation does not wear well at all. I feel like it breaks-up/separates on my skin and looks so messy. 

I have tried to make this work in every way possible- different applicators, primers, setting sprays, powders and there is NO saving this. In my opinion, it is just not worth the money. 

My main issue is with the performance but I'd note that there is also an odor- seriously smells like acrylic paint from the craft store.","","1","Save your money :/",""

I have dry skin so the extra glow and moisture is welcome for me and it mixes fantastic with liquid glow products in the foundation and under it. I can definitely see why people with combo oily skin would not like this product as it could be a bit slippy on too much oil. However, because of my skin type I have not had that problem and the foundation lasts long for me! I would say it a true build able medium coverage. Like, that could not be more accurate. You can definitely build it up or even sheer it down. The ONLY reason I am giving it four stars instead of five is because the shade range is not properly labeled. I was shade-matched in store to 160C. Now, I am fair with neutral undertones and 160c is cool undertones. However, this is definitely a warmer shade than you would typically expect for a cool undertone, it is even too warm for me especially if I keep building it up. So, this leads me to believe there is some misinformation in the shade labeling and you are better off matching in store than ordering online.

So, when I saw Nyx had brought out a semi-affordable option (overpriced for the drugstore imo) I was so excited and tried it out quickly. However, this product looked horrible on the skin! The initial application looks very greasy, but its a cream product so I wasn't that worried. I put on my normal concealer then set with my normal powder. Initially from where I was standing it looked alright, but as I went through the rest of my makeup routine it just looked more and more awful. My pores looked huge. My smile lines were so prominent, and I'm a teenager so I don't really have any. Then the foundation just disappeared above my lip and in spots on my nose. When I was done and taking it off, it took so much micellar water to remove all the makeup from my pores that i'm scared there's some left and I'm gonna break out tomorrow.

I found this and it happened to be on sale in store. I was excited to try it, but when I did it turned my face orange. I wasn't upset because I know this is supposed to settle to your skin tone so I watched it all day. I bought the lightest color you can get and it just turned a lighter orange or tan. My skin is pale or porcelain in some makeup cases. I had to go all day looking like I came from the bakery. Now I'm not totally knocking this foundation. It just wasn't for me. This is a good quality product. It goes on smooth, feels nice and creamy, it doesn't settle, or pronounce your pours. It didn't feel like I had anything on my face and blended well.

Page","https://www.ulta.com/makeup-face-foundation?N=26y5&No=96&Nrpp=96","I'm really sad that this didn't work. I love supporting indie/upcoming brands. I had to find my shade on Uoma's website, since it's more in depth on getting your right shade, and I couldn't try it in person since none of the stores in my area have it. ULTA, you need to put indie/upcoming brands in MORE stores, and not just in select few California stores!
The consistency is SUPER watery. 4-5 pumps needed on my brush to make coverage on half of my face. Those 4-5 pumps is what I also needed to have it sit on top of the bristles and not sink down to the middle of the bristles. With a sponge, it was gone. It was also tricky to apply nice and even without brush or sponge marks. Even with matching online, the foundation was still a bit yellow (I have T2C which should be for fair pink) and then it oxidized orange. And the fragrance! Oh dear. It never goes away and irritated my eyes so much, and I didn't bring it up super close to my eye area! And the smell doesn't go away! I also have oily skin, but with it being winter it's more combo-oily, and it felt noticeably dry. You definitely have to set it with translucent powder. It does not fully dry down on its own.I will say, it was very lightweight, even with 2 layers on. I know that sounds confusing, being I just said it's lightweight, but it's true. The packaging is very lux feeling, minus the cap. Those last two factors helped give it a 2 star instead of 1 Star.
If you can get your shade, you want coverage that you can truly choose how much you want, you can make it work, and have really oily skin, I think this would work for you.","","2","It's a no from me, dawg",""

People complained of it being sticky..  Not at all sticky or wet once it dries. M

Mine has lasted at least 6 hours (with no primer) so I honestly don't understand why people are complaining. Use ""everlasting foundation"" if you want a longer wear product. 

The coverage did a decent job, I have a red scar on my cheek and it covered it just fine (without conceiler). 

Remember to apply by patting in place. Do not rub it in, this might be why people had a poor experience with it.

I was wearing Urban Decay's Naked All-Nighter foundation for years.... because every time I went into Ulta, it was ""highly recommended"" (which honestly felt more like an advertisement rather than a personal recommendation), but finally I had enough and went in there one day and asked could I please have a more personalized recommendation for foundation because Urban Decay's foundation kept ""oxidizing"" and turning orange on my skin, making it not match my neck. A very nice Ulta rep came and helped me find the right shade and she recommended the Amazonian Clay... needless to say I've been hooked ever since!

I have tried setting it with powder, but I don't like powders on my skin and use very little if I have to set my t zone. This one I had to use a bit on the outer perimeter to blend powder blush on.

I had never tried anything from the Smashbox brand, but I read this a great hydrating foundation. Once I tried this I LOVED it!!! It gives a medium/full coverage look and it has a long wear time as well! It doesn't oxidize like other foundations I've tried. It made my skin feel hydrated once I put this on top of my primer, I didn't look dry or cakey. I add just a little extra to build up over my blemishes and it looks flawless.

It's super whipped in texture (hence Soufflé) and it doesn't feel heavy on the skin. I use a makeup spatula to dispense product and a little goes a long way. 

Since it's water based I would avoid using a sponge because it soaks up a lot of the product. I prefer to use a brush instead.

I wouldn't recommend putting a silicone based primer on before hand because it may ball up the product. I just put on some silicone free moisturizer and it goes on great.

It wears beautifully throughout the day and I notice it just evening out my skin tone without completely covering my freckles or making them look like I tried to cover them up and failed.

It's my go to everyday light makeup foundation and i love it.","","5","My skin but better",""

I got a g40( not g40+) in this and it was a pretty good match. It dries quickly during appication, so u have to work fast. The finish is really pretty. Its matt but makes your skin look more blurred versus a flat matt look. It photographed really well. 

I have olive skin that gets very oily so i dont know how   this would work on dry skin? It may cling to patches. 

After about 3 to 4 hrs in (of me sitting at my work desk) my oils broke through. I tried for 2 more days, and the same happened.  i use a light,  non oily moisturizer applied 30 minutes before foundation application. 

The foundation looks beautiful first 3 to 4 hrs, but it did not last on my skin. Ive tried TONS of foundations (nars, mac,  dose of colors, lancome ) and the one that always lasts on my oily skin is estee lauder double wear.","","3","Overall decent",""

In my opinion, if you are more of a natural beauty lover like myself, GET THIS! This is one of the few foundations I've tried that resembles actual skin and dosent look like your wearing something. It's like your skin but better. It has a sheen that isnt necessary dewy but resembles the natural shine your skin has. It is thin, smooth, a bit sheer but is buildable without getting thick sticky or cakey. This isnt for someone looking for a full beat. I reccomend this to pretty much everyone as it is now my holy grail foundation. You dont need much at all to get decent coverage either. One small swipe on each cheekbone, across the forehead and the bridge of the nose. Blend it down and inwards and itll look like a better version of you. I am going to purchase another color in the future to use as a contour stick. Also, dont use a wet or dry beauty blender with this. Itll get streaky. This is made to be used with a foundation brush. All in all I think this is a permanent fixture in my makeup bag! And the shade range is fantastic! What have you go to lose? Buy it!!!!","","5","Looks just like skin I love this!",""

Even when I build it up, it still barely shows up. It doesn't look bad on the skin however, it hid my pores pretty well and the finish was nice. It hid my redness but not the acne/scars. The coverage is definitely that of a BB/CC cream in my opinion and would definitely look better on someone who doesn't need much for their skin and is going for a more natural look. It also doesn't last that long even with trusted primer/powder/setting spray. Definitely something you would just put on for a super natural touch up.

I like estée lauder because of their shade selection, most BB creams were too yellow or too pink.

However, I have to return it because the undertone was not golden enough. It was more warm-orange like. On Temptalia it said that Clinique Even Better in Cream caramel was a dupe for BB 323W but BB was warmer. I think I should have gone for 321W. But regardless, it's always a risk buying foundation online and I don't feel like trying to blind test colors with something so pricy because. And in my area, none of the Ulta's sell Beauty Bakerie which is a shame because my city is predominately populated by Blacks and non-Black ethnic groups! But they all just so happen to have Kylie cosmetics!

Still, I like BB products and it is a great, black-owned alternative to Fenty which is overrated because a pop star is the face of it. However, I think the company need to improve the shade charts that correspond with the model's faces on the original site. 

I will have to return this beauty but I will buy the concealer instead. :)","","4","It's nice but sadly I have to return it. :(",""

Active: Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide

I copied and pasted from the ingredient list above and checked other sites to make sure it wasn't a mistake. Those are BOTH sunscreens, the SAME sunscreens that have been in this product for years. I'm not sure why the packaging changed but the product is still the goods.
The powder itself is great for extra coverage. It fits between a regular light coverage setting powder and a powder foundation. I don't think you could get the kind of coverage they are showing in the promo pics without a lot ... and I do mean a lot of layers. It would be a powder pile on disaster! For example; I apply with a large puffy powder brush when I want to get a little more coverage out of a tinted moisturizer or the it Cc cream. When I'm touching up and topping off my SPF during the day I use the puff or a denser brush. I keep a small face mist in my bag because it's thick ( sunscreen drawback ) and when using this way unless you give it some moisture it's going to be a noticeably heavy powder look. Not cakey, just noticeably heavy. It does add to coverage but there's no way it is going to give full coverage or even medium. 
Their Celebration foundation ( the illumination version is fantastic ) is a great option if you want a powder foundation. The CC powder isn't a foundation and I'm puzzled why they are marketing it that way since it will only lead to disappointed customers. 
If you want additional coverage or need an easy way to bump up your SPF throughout the day this is a really nice powder.","","5","It still has SPF!!!",""

I am over 60 (just barely!) and most foundations I tried aged me, settled in the lines, looked like a mask, etc.  Liquid Minerals goes on beautifully, does not settle, provides a very natural look and nice coverage. It did take me a few tries to get the hang of application because  I used my fingertips to apply my foundation. I switched to a foundation brush, which was a bit of an adjustment for me, but it works wonderfully with the Liquid Minerals (Radiant) foundation.

When I first applied this, I was SUPER impressed with how full coverage it is. That is one of the main reasons I will continue to keep trying this out, because I love the coverage and the finish. I think it was a great start to powder foundations for me. 

However, it made me really oily within a few hours. I'm not sure if that's powder foundation in general for me (I haven't tried many yet), because I do tend to be an oily person. I just really wish this wouldn't make me so oily, because I really like the product otherwise. But, for the price and the coverage, it's not too bad of a deal!

It's my new go-to foundation for face and body. Covers up dark eye circles, acne, and freckles on my arms amazingly. Matches my skin tone, amazing coverage and pigmentation. It's hard enough to find a foundation for porcelain skin, even harder to find a quality one that actually covers and doesn't oxidize. I was woefully disappointed by Two Faced full coverage foundation in Cloud after it matched me but didn't cover well at all and left my skin feeling wet. As long as you blend well and set, this won't crease, as with most foundations, but heavier applications in places such as under the eyes may crease.
This makeup is definitely heavy in pigmentation, but also in weight and feel. Great for oily/combination skin but dry skin or light makeup users might not enjoy. Be careful what powders you use or it may turn color, but an otherwise fantastic product I will buy again and again.","","5","Amazing Full Coverage Makeup for Pale Skin!",""

It has SPF, and I only noticed that because my face wasn't getting light burns while being outside anymore. There are so many hues to choose from, I found the one that best matches my skin and red undertones. It's a powder, but it mattes to my skin within the first 30 minutes of putting it on.

It is a very dense foundation and tugs horribly on your skin if you are to apply it straight from the tube. I suggest using a sponge or Blendiful to get the product out of the tube and then applying to face. 
Once on your face there is very little coverage. And it is heavy.
And it does not look seamless. Gathers weirdly and does not play well with other products.
Not to mention the horrible shade range.

My large pores just loved to magnify the moment foundation touched my face. This held true even when using Fenty or MAC foundations. I happened upon this foundation one day while perusing the store and found a shade that perfectly matched (another struggle I had failed at more often than not). At the price point, this felt like a gamble I would be stupid not to take. After the first use, I thought surely this was a joke; how could this drugstore-priced foundation far exceed the results of makeup triple this price? But it isn't a joke and months later, my skin is still in love with this product. It has never made me break out; it doesn't flake or congeal as the day wears on; it covers my imperfections with ease; it works in tandem with every primer I've used with it. The bottle is large and lasted several months, even with usage at least 5 days a week. The doe-foot applicator is ideal for putting the product directly onto the skin and for minimizing any unnecessary waste of makeup. It's mattifying without being too drying, yet allows for a glowing, dewy appearance at certain angles. It's the best of both worlds. It doesn't fill my pores quite like I'd like, but my primer is now responsible for that. I don't think there is any foundation out there that will address my personal crater-sized pores. I've bought this a few times now to keep handy (and shade-match for the summertime) and between its effectiveness as a foundation and the price, there is no competition.","","5","Better than a lot of ""high-end"" foundations",""

It lasted ALL DAY without a feeling of wearing a lot of makeup.  I used it for years and I had many friends who did as well.  We all agree that this new formula is not only not improved, but it's really bad.  It does not go on evenly, it dries on in patches.  I am not a fan of the finish either.  It's too matte and makes my skin look dry.  The past year has been nothing but me buying and trying various foundations to find one I like as well as the old formula and so far, not one of them has come close.  It has been extremely frustrating.  I tried a few other EL foundations and I haven't loved those either.  My friends who used the original have also moved on to other brands and haven't found one they like as well..  My quest for the original DWL replacement continues...

Not matte, not what I'd call dewy either. I have super sensitive skin. Everything breaks me out. This doesn't. I also am pale but Mediterranean so my skin tone is a yellow/olive and that's hard to find as most are darker when in that shade. I love this foundation and I don't mind the price either. I wear it 5 days a week and a bottle lasts me probably 4 months. A little goes a very long way.

I've been using this product for a couple of years now. Just now leaving a review! 😅 
This product is amazing. If I could give it 1000 stars, I most certainly would! It's so full coverage. I love the concealer+foundation mix. It's perfect. Doesn't leave any streaking, lasts FOREVER because it doesn't take much to get that coverage, definitely lives up to all of its claims, there are so many different color options, it's buildable, there are so many great things about this product! I usually use a cheaper foundation if I'm just running a couple quick errands and use this for work, going out, etc. When I use my cheaper foundation.. I use this one for my concealer! Which is awesome! There's just toooo many good things to say about it. It's definitely worth the price. Ladies, if you haven't given this a try.. DO SO NOW! 😍","","5","LOVE. LOVE. ABSOLUTELY.

From youtubers to reading almost every review. I was extremely hopeful and I just had to try it for myself. I used to be a huge estee lauder double hour wear fan. But either my skin has changed or the product itself but it doesn't look right on my skin anymore. I read on some this still had full coverage without the cake so I wanted to give it a go. One thing that was VERY difficult was choosing the right shade. This is not the kind of foundation that can be tried just by sight of swatch. It does oxidize on the skin but the color was still too light for me. Aside from the shade, it seeped into my pores and fine lines. I have combination skin but lately it has been more on the dry side. I decided to use it with a moisturizer and smash box photo finish primer. It was a little better but the problem was still present. I'm 30 years old and I don't have bad skin but I also don't have injections in my face lol I feel if I had smoother or younger skin this would sit nicely. That is not the case for me! It's still highlights my pores around my nose and fine lines around my eyes or forehead. Unfortunately, I have to pay for shipping to return the item which I think is unfair due to the fact that stores are closed and I'm unable to return to the store and find something else for my skin and my shade.

Consistency is more liquidy than what I'm used to, but this spread so easily and effortlessly with a brush. It worked well with my everyday primer, and did not leave my face feeling dry even after setting with a light powder and setting spray.

I normally like full coverage, but after one round of application I loved how natural it looked and didn't feel like I needed to add more layers. It looked just like my skin but simply healthier and evened out. ( this took 2 full pumps to achieve on me, and I'm a guy with a big face ) 

This does have a subtle scent, but it is not overwhelming and it quickly went away after applying. I actually really liked it, much subtler than others I currently own.

My problem areas ( t-zone ) did get a bit oily throughout the day, but this is entirely me and is completely normal.  And even then, the foundation stayed in place until the end of the night when I washed and cleansed my face.

Really love this, definitely a new favorite.","","5","New Favorite Foundation",""

I applied it with paddle brushes from several brands (e.g. Tarte Double Duty Beauty Paddle to Perfection Foundation Brush, Real Techniques Blend + Blur Foundation Brush), and I always got a beautiful, blurred finish. However, I like medium-to-full coverage, which this foundation doesn't provide on its own, so I mixed it with the Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Matte Foundation to provide more coverage and to help my foundation last for an entire work day.

The negative comes from the packaging, which is absolutely terrible. It is hard to get product out with the dropper. Then, when I close the top, foundation leaks out of the sides, and the clean up process is messy and wastes more product. I also have to remember to shake the bottle well and to always apply it with a paddle brush, which can be a hassle because I only have a few of those kind of brushes.

I received this as a Diamond gift, which I appreciate because I most likely would not have tried this foundation on my own. However, I do not see myself purchasing this foundation unless the packaging is redesigned.","","4","Good Lightweight Foundation with Terrible Packaging",""

It did not have a Full Coverage as it described but it had a good medium coverage. I tried several different methods to apply this foundation but never found the right one. Brush, sponge, fingers, wet sponge, different primers. This isn't the easiest to blend out. The best ""application"" I got was with a damp sponge, but the foundation broke down twice as quick. Using a dense brush was the best coverage I got, but I felt like I had to use twice as much foundation to cover my face. I really liked this product, but I didn't think for the price I was getting the best bang for my buck, Maybe if it goes on sale. 
Good medium coverage, powdery soft finish. Not super oil absorbing, I did have to powder about 6 hours in. Great for the days where I didn't have a lot of breakouts.","","4","I actually liked this, But ended up returning it.",""

This goes on so smooth and streak-free and very little is required to cover the whole face. It can look cakey if too much is applied. It tends to retain its tackiness, so setting it is a must. I find that if it starts to settle into fine lines, it can be pressed back in to place. I have normal mature skin. I'm not sure that it would be ideal for oily skin types or areas with high humidity. It's wonderful on dry days. (My shade: 080W Brillant)","","5","My new favorite",""

It emphasized every bit of texture I've got and clings to dry patches. I had issues with it settling into pores, and as the day went on it broke apart along my smile lines and forehead lines. By the 10 hour mark, it went from looking dry and a bit dehydrated to looking greasy, and my skin generally does not produce enough oil to affect my makeup (normal to dry). Most product was worn away or gunked up around movement areas by the 10 hour mark. You can see close-ups in my review on youtube (geek out of water). If you're not dealing with texture issues or dry skin, this might work for you, but on dry, mature skin, it was a no-go for me. I had the same problems with the concealer, unfortunately. In terms of color, the lightest shade Porcelain is not very fair. It is almost an exact match to the Estee Lauder Double Wear Stay in Place in 1C1 Cool Bone. I'm usually mid to dark in the ""fair"" range of most foundations. This shade was a very good match for me, but if you're more pale, it will likely be too dark.","","1","Accentuates texture and clings to dry patches",""

Or a shock when people see me barefaced. Feels good to wash off at the end of the day with no breakouts and inflammation, actually helped me stay clear. Anyways, a couple months ago I ran out and was trying to find it but was having a hard time. Didn't realize they changed their image. It didn't say new look or formula on their new label so I expected it would apply and work the same way. 

I work part time so those are days I apply makeup. I noticed by the end of the day my makeup has been dried out and cracking which shouldn't happen because my off days I stay moisturized. And I'll have a clogged pore and irritated spots every time by the end of the day! Never been so happy to wash it off. 

I looked up why and apparently they upped the salicylic acid from 0.5 - 2.0%. This messes up with my skincare regimen and causing irritation. It's frustrating because the company didn't address the change in the product. I didn't bother to search up what else may have changed, so I just tossed it in the trash. Back to the drawing board on finding the perfect foundation !!

I'm in my mid 30's now and have managed to keep my acne under control (a few blemishes at a time) for about the last 10 years but my skin is super sensitive, disgustingly oily and prone to congestion.  There are literally only 3 or 4 foundations I can use that don't aggravate my skin.  Since Urban Decay stupidly decided to discontinue their tried-and-true, cult classic Naked Skin foundation, I felt safe making this my new go-to.  The coverage is medium at best, taking 3 full pumps to obtain that coverage which is quite a bit and unfortunately did not keep my oil under control throughout the day.  I started using this back in December and it took about two weeks of using that I started breaking out but I honestly didn't think it was from the foundation--generally if something is comedogenic for me, I break out within just a day or so.  I really felt all these breakouts were hormonal given my age.  Fast forward to the end of March and I've had the worse acne ever.  My face is full of large, red, painful cystic acne on top of skin texture that looks like a popcorn wall.  I finished the bottle and with high hopes switched back to Becca Ever-Matte foundation.  Within about a week of switching foundations my skin has gotten so much better!  Acne cysts less painful and inflamed and skin less textured. I have since researched some of the ingredients in this foundation and was surprised to read about one such ingredient ""Acrylonitrile/​Methyl Methacrylate/​Vinylidene Chloride Copolymer"" which is a plastic and is used in acrylic nails.  It can be very comedogenic because it is a plastic it can occlude the skin.  It's also listed as an endocrine disruptor.  According to the CDC website,  acrylontrile is extremely carcinogenic.  Why on earth would Urban Decay choose to put such an ingredient in something we are applying to our faces? Would never repurchase.","","1","Worst acne of my life",""

Page","https://www.ulta.com/makeup-face-foundation?N=26y5&No=96&Nrpp=96","I have tried nearly every drugstore foundation and many high-end foundations in search of the best one for my skin. I have oily, acne-prone skin with rosacea and scarring. I need foundations to last through a long work day and to provide full coverage. I have very pale skin with a yellow-neutral undertone, which can be hard to match. 

This foundation is a great product in a few ways: it is long lasting and provides full (medium buildable) coverage. I would agree that it is 3 in 1: I don't have to use a primer with this, and I don't need concealer either.  It is great for vacations because I don't need as many products, and it has SPF! The locking pump is also great. It goes on matte and becomes a natural looking finish after about an hour on my skin. After a full, long day, it can begin looking oily. Another bonus for my sensitive skin is that I have never broken out from wearing this foundation. 

I personally have fine lines and this creases pretty quickly for me. It is not transfer proof (but what is). My biggest issue is the color - if there was a lighter, less pink based pale color, then this would be maybe five stars. The lightest color, 805, goes on nearly a match for me but after oxidizing it is clearly not a match. I have to blend this with another foundation to get a closer color. 

Overall, I would recommend this foundation due to the coverage and lasting power.","","4","Nearly HG Status",""

I visited a MAC store near my hotel in Vegas and discussed my concerns with an artist (Gregory) who recommended this foundation stick to spot conceal and I love it! It's a perfect match for my fair skin, blends so easily so I don't have to cover my whole face with it (just my red areas and my dark circles) and it even blurs my pores while allowing my freckles to shine through. My husband prefers no makeup, and this makes us both happy by covering my problem spots while not looking ""all made up."" I agree with other reviewers that it can look a little dry, but Gregory gave me a good tip about spritzing my brush with some setting spray for when I blend and that works great for me! Also have no problem with it lasting all day (or longer). I even forgot to remove my makeup after our late flight home, and my makeup still looked perfect the next morning! My only concern is that the 13 is as light as it goes. My daughter is SO much lighter than me, so I'm hoping that by the time she's old enough to start using makeup there will be more options for her very porcelain skin.","","5","Great Match and Natural Look!",""

My biggest problem with brands is that they don't have a big enough range to help with differences in clientele shade/tone. I would even be thrilled if they didn't carry my shade in stores but did online, but sadly this is not the case. As someone who is of nordic descent majority of brands (especially in the usa and international) don't carry shades that are diverse and inclusive enough. Frankly I don't want to look like a orange when I walk outside and go to work and or out shopping.

Please broaden your range, the costumer base will thank you and come to buy your products. Fenty Beauty and Nyx are showing what drugstore brands and luxury brands can do for range of products and are listening to consumers, step up to the plate and compete. 

I was hoping that the color of the product could be lightened with Manic Panic Virgin Dream-tone Gothic Foundation Vampire White or L.A. Girl Pro Matte Mixing Pigment Foundation but sadly didn't do well, I bought it because in the store it was beautiful in its coverage and performance.

For those who have darker complexions than mine it could work well but for deeper skin tones (darker than cool deep) it will not do well.","","2","Love coverage but not enough shades available",""

Page","https://www.ulta.com/makeup-face-foundation?N=26y5&No=96&Nrpp=96","I'll start with my skincare routine, but spare a lot of the boring details. After cleansing, I apply 8 products – serums, oils, moisturizers,sunblock – to my face. Finding a foundation that will go on and stay on is difficult, not impossible, but difficult. On a recommendation from a friend who also considers skincare most important, I purchased this. My first purchase was through Stila. I found what I thought should have been my usual color, but when I received it, it was too light and a just a tad too pink. Still, I wanted to test it. It's a thin, watery foundation, which I'm familiar with because of my Chanel. I quickly figured out that it goes on best when doing one area at a time, smoothing it in with my fingers, running my Clarisonic Foundation Brush over my face, then quickly bouncing a BeautyBlender around my hair line. It doesn't take any longer than any other foundation application for me. My concealer goes on effortlessly. It lasts all day. My skincare doesn't disrupt it, and it leaves this beautiful, natural, skin-like finish. I decided to keep the color that was too light, and buy a shade that in most foundations would have been too dark, then mix them together. It was a good call. I grab for this foundation more than any of my others, and I have a lot of great foundations. I would have given this 5 stars if the color selection would have been made a little easier to figure out. Then again, if I would have taken the time to look up swatches, I may have gotten the right color on the first try. For reference my skin concerns and battles are fine lines, combination, oily/dry, and my skincare routine is built around moisturizing. I've learned that if I moisturize properly, my skin doesn't secrete oils that congest my pores. I have light skin with yellow undertones.","","4","This foundation is amazing, after you figure out...",""

I read a review that said to apply with a beauty blender instead of your fingers and I think that it looks super even and smooth with the beauty blender, but I haven't tried using my fingers. I tend to have oily skin with a few dry patches and this is the first product I've ever used that didn't cause my skin to be any extra oily; I set it with a bit of setting powder and my skin stays a perfect balance between shiny and matte all day with no touch ups! If you have dry skin though it may not be the best for you. It also hasn't caused any breakouts. Definitely will be using a lot and buying again!","","5","Love it",""

All I can say is this must have been given away as PR and that's why all the great reviews on YouTube.  After put this one lightly with a beauty blender, it looks ok, then a few minutes later its setting, my pores look magnified, my skin looks cakey dull and lifeless.  I thought it was the primer. the next day I did my same routine, used a different primer. Same effect. 
this went on for 5 days. I'm done. tonight both bottles go into my giving bag.

I was looking for a more organic option and thought this would be good. When I first applied it I thought it covered great and felt great other than a little cakey, but I could work with that.

After using this for a couple months, I was very disappointed in this foundation. I had to use a lot of product to get a medium to full coverage so I ran out of this bottle in 2 months with moderate everyday use. Usually bottles this size last me 3-4 months or even longer, so it felt like a lot of money for such a short usage. 

The most disappointing thing was that as I was wearing it, throughout the day I could see the pigment separate on my skin leaving my face spotted and oily! 

As soon as the foundation got even the slightest drizzle of rain or a tear on an emotional day, it just ran right off and left noticeable streaks. It also came off and transfered very easily. It felt like a lot of the makeup ended up coming off throughout the day or made me look sweaty/oily even in the dead of winter. Very disappointing. :(

I love their mission and vision to be more natural and plant based, but it was not worth the money and the product did not hold up for me.","","1","The foundation separated throughout the day",""

I bought this on a whim and  am surprised that I actually love it! I normally wear high end foundation for my NC20 mixed ethnicity skin due to the shade ranges and better formulations. IMO, the Matte Ambition formula is superior to other CoverGirl foundations, and I have been wearing it everyday. It's better than most high end foundations I've tried. I gave Matte Made a chance, but was disappointed and returned it. Matte Ambition covers my acne acars and melasma very well, stays put all day with no need for touchups (makeup on at 5am, off at 8pm), blurs my large pores, and doesn't make my combo skin break out. This foundation DOES oxidise on me however. I wear Neutral 1, but it oxidises a shade darker. If there was a Neutral 0 or 00, I'm sure it would be perfect! PLEASE expand your shade range, as you have an awesome product here!","","4","Love It, But Needs More Shades!",""

I am 51 years old, and have been using foundation for about 2 years, so I guess I'm still learning. The stuff we had when I was a teen was terrible. It was chalky and turned orange by lunchtime. I hated it, so I just lived without it. 
Since I lived most of my youth outside (without sunscreen) my skin has some hyperpigmentation. Not cute little freckles, but large age-spots. Plus I've developed rosacea, so I needed something. 
I tried over a dozen different foundations before I received a sample of this and I was hooked! I love it. It's easy to use, never looks chalky, never changes colors. 
It also lasts a long time. I'm on my second container in 2 years, so I'm getting about a year out of each pot, and I use it daily.","","5","The best foundation I've ever tried",""

Let me explain how I think this happens. When companies are doing shade testing, they aren't testing the shades on people who actually HAVE a cool undertone & so anything is going to LOOK too pink on someone who has a yellow or neutral to warm undertone, the shade automatically gets labeled as being cool when it really isn't. Now because that shade wasn't tested on a skin tone that actually has a very pink undertone like mine, it's going to look extremely orange on me. The shade I chose was 5 & it is described as being medium with cool pink undertones. Now the description & the picture looks like it would definitely be a match for me. When I opened it and put it on my skin, I was SURE I was sent the wrong shade & I wasn't. This happens ALL THE TIME & not just with Tarte foundations, but with MOST companies especially higher end brands. If you don't actually have a pink undertone, these companies should not deem a shade as being cool because you're not going to get accuracy when creating shades. I can't be the only super cool undertone that complains about this. Most shades are too orange for me despite how they're labeled, described or pictured. I'm tired of having to ""make things work"" & in 2020, I shouldn't have to! Believe me, I get it when people complain that companies aren't inclusive as far as offering shades that are not light or dark enough because it is these same brands that aren't including shades that are pink enough. I'm attaching a pic of what Tarte deems as a cool/pink shade & what that looks like up against a skin tone that actually has a true pink undertone. You tell me if I'm crazy. Oh lets not leave out how you're supposed to shake before using but if you don't allow the bottle to sit for SEVERAL MINUTES after shaking that it will leak all over the bottle too. I gave 2 stars bcz the formula might be good","","2","Nope",""

After spending $30-$45/bottle on prestige brands and not getting the results I wanted, I tried this as a ""quick fix"" one day and I absolutely love it. I have combination skin, along with some rosacea and this went on beautifully! It's not heavy, doesn't flake. I don't like tons of coverage but I do have a lot of redness, so I definitely need some. I use this along with some bronzer and blush and highlighter and it is perfect. I am super happy with this and I don't think I will ever try another prestige brand again.

I can opt for light or medium coverage from this - depending upon how I apply it. For a light coverage, usually when at home and not needing as much on, I dot a small amount of Sheer Glow around my face & neck, and use a slightly damp beauty blender to blend in. This gives a slightly dewy finish too. When I need more coverage and a more matte finish I apply with fingertips only. In either case this does slightly oxidize within the first hour or so, so if it doesn't look spot-on at first, give it a bit of time before reaching any conclusions. For me the color match is fantastic, it looks like I'm not wearing anything, very natural and a nice luminous look, or a 'sheer glow' if you like! Longevity is also great - I can get almost a full day out of this without it turning patchy or creasing. The only downside is there's no pump on the bottle - which for something at this price range I would have expected it to have as a given, and also no SPF in here so I have to apply an SPF separately, before my primer and this. On the upside though the absence of SPF means my face is much more flash-photography friendly, something I rarely achieve with any of the SPF foundations I have. -> My 'Ulta Beauty Top 7 must-have list' (thought it might be useful to share my 7 favorite beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Ulta) < - < 1.

I have normal skin that can lean more dry or combo depending on the weather. I find if I use this powder with a light hand it will help my makeup last all day and make my face look flawless. If I accidentally use too much though I find it can make my face look drying. If I do have texture or dryness on my face it will not sit well, but once my makeup warms to my skin temperature the textured areas do look much better. One thing I really like about this powder is it doesn't settle into fine lines or wrinkles like the Maybelline Loose Setting Powder does. I also enjoy that there is no scent. This powder provides some coverage. This powder does help control oil. If I were to compare it to the Maybelline Loose Setting Powder though, I think Maybelline does a slightly better job. I wouldn't mind purchasing this again but I think I would prefer to try a powder from Covergirl's line that provides some radiance. Since getting older I have realized matte products are a bit much for my skin since it only gets oily in the summer months.

This is VERY specific type of concealer, the closest thing I can think to compare it to is the Glossier stretch concealer, because it's very emollient and has light to medium (if you build it up) coverage. Anyone who says this concealer is cakey or full coverage is 100% applying it too heavily, you should Not draw it on in thick lines (as tempting as that can be), and I find it easiest to blend under the eyes with a fingertip, but it works just as well with a brush.

This concealer is for someone like me; very dry skin, only requires light to medium coverage under the eyes, looking for a non-drying dewy-to-satinish finish. If you're not that specific consumer you may not like it, so be aware.

TLDR; if you're looking for an affordable almost-dupe of Glossier stretch concealer and you fit into this shade range, you've come to the right place.

P.S. This shade range is a joke, Covergirl, get it together.","","5","10/10 would recommend",""

This is VERY specific type of concealer, the closest thing I can think to compare it to is the Glossier stretch concealer, because it's very emollient and has light to medium (if you build it up) coverage. Anyone who says this concealer is cakey or full coverage is 100% applying it too heavily, you should Not draw it on in thick lines (as tempting as that can be), and I find it easiest to blend under the eyes with a fingertip, but it works just as well with a brush.

This concealer is for someone like me; very dry skin, only requires light to medium coverage under the eyes, looking for a non-drying dewy-to-satinish finish. If you're not that specific consumer you may not like it, so be aware.

TLDR; if you're looking for an affordable almost-dupe of Glossier stretch concealer, you've come to the right place.

P.S. This shade range is a joke Covergirl, get it together.","","5","10/10 would recommend",""

The sponge applicator is so flimsy that it doesn't blend the concealer properly and instead adds more product to the face as you try to blend. This is surprising considering how it says, ""super blendable"" on the stick. Lies. The concealer also gushes out the sides of the sponge placing the product everywhere BUT the spot you're trying to conceal. The way you have to twist the bottom of the stick to make the concealer come out is also weird and confusing. The concealer itself is very cakey but does provide decent coverage. I ordered fair to match my pale complexion and now I look like I slapped pancake batter on my face. The yellow undertones defeat the purpose of me trying to HIDE my pimples.

There isn't a way for me to physically blend it at all, because it just slides off and removed anything and everything underneath. I tried instead using it underneath my foundation to cover up blemishes and start with a more even base and brightened under-eyes. The problem there is that as I apply my foundation, all of the concealer rubs right off. I can't find a way to actually use this product successfully, so the fact that the shades are perfect is rendered totally useless. It's difficult to apply in the first place because it's almost hard, it isn't creamy or smooth at all and it pulls on my skin as I try to apply it. I don't know what on Earth that hard little nub brush is supposed to accomplish, but it streaks the product off of the skin with no resemblance to blending. This wasn't worth the price, and I'll be sticking to my $5 E.L.F camp concealer.","","3","Disappointed is an understatement",""

It also looks a little dry on me, which is surprising given its almost serum-y like texture. It gives me about a light to medium coverage, and I can still see the discoloration from my under eyes very easily. My biggest issue is that it oxidizes so bad on me. I originally bought a medium shade but it turned into a color darker than my tan olive skin tone. After exchanging it, I had bought light-medium golden and it still turned darker and almost peachier. Despite it turning peachier, it still didn't do well at cancelling the discoloration under my eyes.

You can layer this and it won't cake up.  It's just the perfect concealer. It also pairs perfectly with Benefit's Erase Paste and Lemonade without looking cakey or overly made up.

Bought this just to try as I had a coupon and I was so pleasantly surprised by the difference it made!!  It is not for heavy concealing concerns but just for subtle brightening and non-shimmery highlighting. I am Asian - fair skin and dark hair - and purchased the Light shade. This color works well for me. I advance the color up and use the handy applicator to draw on a few lines under my eyes. I use my clean ring finger to gently pat and blend the color in, extending it to the tops of my cheekbones and even the inner corners of my eyes. On my 47 year-old skin, it does not settle into my fine lines.  I love this and cannot go without it for even a single day!  I hope this is never discontinued!","","5","Hope this is never discontinued!",""

For me, it just didn't blend well or do me justice. So, I gave it to my mom. She's very tan, and I used this under her eyes & baked it... Wow it looked amazing on her. Her under eyes were white as snow and she looked 20 years younger. She wore it out and while doing yard work outside in 80 degree weather. Still no creasing at the end of the day. So for her, it worked 5/5. For me, 1/5 because it didn't work for my fair, dry skin. It was a waste of money for myself, but I'm glad my mom enjoys it. Instead, I ordered concealer from KKW with the baking and brightening powder. I wish I could give a higher review because I love Kylie Cosmetics products.

Please do NOT DISCONTINUE or change formula!  It is PERFECT.

I ordered three different samples and this really helped me figure out what looks best on my skintone.  I am not extremely fair, but I'm not a medium.  Now that I have the correct color, all my other makeup looks SO MUCH BETTER.  I have light skin with pink undertones and a little peach.  I thought I was neutral but neutral has too much yellow for me.   Please do not discontinue this color because I will be back again and again to reorder.  I have tried so many different concealers colors and brands trying to figure out the correct shade and consistency. Other brands that conceal well are very thick and not smooth enough.  The consistency is perfect and did not fall into my creases.   

The pink undertone is very necessary for me because I have dark circles and a small dark blue vein around one of my eyes.  I have had this since I was very young and my skin is very transparent in color around my eyes.  I was shocked at how well it covered my imperfections without looking like I actually had makeup on.  I also did not even have add a pink base concealer with it.  I frequently have problems with concealing this blue vein with other expensive brands and believe me, you name it, I've tried it.  With the correct shade and undertone of pink, I was able to mask the dark circle and vein flawlessly with minimal primer. I do always use an eye cream though.

 I use the IT cosmetics concealer brush and you have to use very little of this product for it to go a long way.   I will definitely be reordering in a larger size now that I figured out my shade.  I can use the other sample colors on other areas of my face and blend it in with my concealer without a problem.  Now that I have my concealer correct, I will probably be back to correct my foundation shade as well.","","5","I plan to reorder the larger size.  LIGHT w/PINK UNDERTONES",""

The mixture of yellow with a bit of the apricot color works wonders for the eye area! And stays ALL DAY without setting powder/spray. A light coat of the green is great for any redness- wear it under your concealer or foundation for a more polished look. (The green can be a little chalky, so apply sparingly and in good lighting). I am impressed how beautifully this product applies and blends. Totally replaced the need for undereye concealer for me. (The drugstore concealers always look textured or cakey after a few hours on me- not this stuff!)

For reference, I am 32 years old with combination oily skin that is sensitive and acne-prone. No issues or reactions after 2 weeks of use.","","5","Bye bye undereye concealer!",""

It dries sooo quickly and it is hard to blend. If you get past the initial application and you're able to apply powder, it creases like crazy and leaves a very think, flakey layer. The only thing that makes this go away is drowning my face in Mac fix +, but that's not worth it for such a cheap concealer. I've also tried applying different amounts like just dotting it over my face and swiping it like other concealers but it looks terrible either way. A little goes a long way and i think it actually blends out better with a brush than with a beauty blended. I have super dry, flakey skin and this concealer honestly makes it look so much worse. Maybelline concealers have never done this. I'd honestly recommend Makeup Revolution's concealer. Much better dupe for shape tape.","","2","Dry Skin Avoid!",""

There's a little more creasing than I'd expect from such a dry formula, and when I set it with my beloved Aquasurance powder foundation (or any other powder I've tried), I get bunching. Normal eye moisture causes this concealer to break up, so it's not waterproof at all. It took a lot of work to make it look smooth around my eyes. It's also extremely light in color. I bought a shade that's 2 shades deeper than what I'd usually select, and it's still a little too light (see photo). Basically, you can use this to point conceal or highlight smooth oily places on the face--but I would keep it away from any place with lines or dryness or moisture. At this price point, I'd get Elf camo instead.","","2","Too drying and not even a little waterproof",""

Another review said to let it sit for a bit before blending so it can be built up so I will give that a try. This is very similar to Glossier's skin tint in its sheerness and consistency if that helps.

IT DOESNT CREASE, I mean AT ALL and I've tried it on multiple occasions with different foundations and powders. It doesn't settle in my little fine lines under my eyes and it looks great at the end of the day. While the shades are SLIM, I found one that works for me and ITS AMAZING.

First thing you should know, this is not a full coverage concealer & if that's what you're looking for, then there are plenty of them out there & this brand offers a couple of them too. So giving this a poor review bcz of that really isn't fair bcz it's not marketed to be one. But if you're looking for something that has a light to medium buildable coverage, blends out super easily (too easy??), brightens in a snap, then this might work for you. This is not for covering major dark circles or erasing discolorations or scars, etc. This is for light covering while simultaneously brightening. It will help conceal slight veins on the lids or brightening under the eyes or high points of the face but it's not meant to compete with a high coverage foundation. It might be good for spot concealing if you can find your exact shade match. I normally don't use an under eye concealer because it's just too noticeable on me but this is something that I've come to like because it brightens nicely without it looking like I have too much makeup on. I feel like if I want something to stand out on my face, I definitely don't want it to be my concealer. I'll save the focal point for eyeshadow or a bright lip. This would be fantastic too for those who gravitate towards a no makeup look.  I've also used this to prime my lids & it's nice for that but only if I'm doing a more natural eye look. Otherwise I use a heavier eye base or primer. The formula is light but not dry like many having thus consistency. It doesn't have that major dry down like the maybelline age rewind or elf camo. But it also doesn't erase and cover like those do either. This is different than those.","","4","Different from what I was expecting",""

This concealer has a weird consistency (very hard, kind of waxy, like a waxy lip balm), but when you rub your finger (or brush) on it, it's immediately usable and a couple of swirls gives you more than enough product to begin applying. With the amount I use for my under-eye-area and the occasional blemish or red spot, this little pot will last FOREVER. I've had no breakouts or irritation and the BUFF color (second to lightest) is a perfect match for my skin tone. It's super easy to apply whether with a finger or a brush and I've found that it lasts all day. If you need heavier coverups, you might need to apply several layers and or set it to get the same lasting power.","","5","Great Product",""

I was pleased with the coverage. However, within a few hours, the results took a turn for the worse. The coverage became very patchy and caked on my skin.

It is a very dense foundation and tugs horribly on your skin if you are to apply it straight from the tube. I suggest using a sponge or Blendiful to get the product out of the tube and then applying to face. 
Once on your face there is very little coverage. And it is heavy.
And it does not look seamless. Gathers weirdly and does not play well with other products.
Not to mention the horrible shade range.

I thought the product itself was a bit greasy and made my under eye area look shiny and drew more attention to it.  The other side of the tube called ""cover"" did little to hide any blemishes or discolored skin I applied it to.

Best thing I love about this concealer (and BM for that matter), is that their ingredients are natural and never feel cakey or heavy on my skin, which is important to me. ❤","","5","Magician in a tube!!",""

The finish is flesh like and I found that the undertone/shade matches my skin perfectly. Dark circles were never an issue for me but I didn't think I could look so awake without using a concealer that was 3 shades lighter. I find it best if you very lightly set your under eye. I personally prefer to not set my this concealer as my skin isn't very oily under the eye. 

Can't wait to finish the two foundations I have so I can buy the Uoma one.","","5","First concealer that made me go wow",""

It's a solid small pot of long-lasting pigment (I use NC42) and it lasts for ages. Compact enough to slip into any bag or purse, with an SPF of 35 which means if I've concealed a blemish left behind after a breakout, there's no way any UV rays are going to darken those marks! I don't use this for large areas as I find it looks slightly orange-y on me (yet I cannot find another shade that blends in so well when using on just a tiny area, weird huh?). What I do is apply with the tiniest brush possible, such as MAC's Synthetic Pointed Liner brush, directly onto any minor blemish in a dabbing motion, and within seconds it's as though it was never there! I'm one of those people who hardly ever touch my face at all (good job, considering...) but I guess for those that do you would need to use a setting powder as this will not stay on otherwise. One very slight issue I've had has been the transparent plastic lid caving in. Previously I've been able to push it until it clicks back in place, but on my most recent pot this hasn't been possible and it refuses to stay put. Not the biggest of problems but would be better if more sturdy. Otherwise I cannot fault this and will continue to use for as long as it's around. -> My 'Ulta Beauty Top 7 must-have list' (thought it might be useful to share my 7 favorite beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Ulta) < - < 1.

There's a lot of shades along with some great correctors too! I chose the pink one bcz I have several concealers that I like the consistency & formula of but the undertone is off. For example, I have a VERY cool undertone to my skin, but I'm not overly fair or light so it's difficult for me to find foundations & concealers that are in the light to light-medium - medium range while still having a VERY pink undertone. You see when a warm-toned person puts on a foundation or concealer that's too pink, it's automatically called ""cool toned"", so then someone who has a cool undertone tries on this same concealer or foundation, it's still incredibly yellow or orangey looking on me. So companies are oftentimes testing their shades on people who's skin isn't pink enough to begin with & it's the very reason why the products that are labeled as being ""cool toned"" really aren't - they just look too cool toned up against a warm or yellow undertone. These brands NEED to test their shades on people that already have that truly cool undertone in order to be able to offer shades that will actually match s1 like me. It's so rare I find a true shade match & it's even more rare to find a concealer or foundation that's in the light-medium range & still maintain a TRUE cool/pink undertone. So I bought this pink corrector to add in to my concealers. I buy them deep enough & add in this pink corrector & it lightens the shade while cooling off the undertone so it's more  pink and thus a match for me. It's the only way Im able to obtain a match for my semi-unusual skin color. I'm tired of having to ""make things work"" but this isn't too bad bcz it has a really beautiful smooth, creamy, hydrating formula that isn't too hydrating/drying & nice pigmentation. They don't have my perfect shade, but by adding a pink corrector to a deeper shade, I can get a match and a great formula!","","4","I see why people have liked this for so many years",""

It was the most amazing thing I've ever felt but because it is made for women of color, even the lightest shade was not a match for me. I'm a light-medium Olive tone. Imans version also came with an applicator sponge. Purs sponge is superior but the powder to cream formula feels the same - smooth and delightful. So cool how it turns from powder to cream, provides good coverage but most important doesn't not crease or make my undereye area appear older - which has been the case with the hundreds of concealers I've tried in the past. I'm so happy I found this. Despite my medium skin tone I went with the light which seems to match well as it dries a tad darker Than it seems.

I got the lightest shade to use for cut creases on my eye shadow because I didn't want to keep using my regular concealer & I'm really disappointed with this one. Barely any product comes out on the applicator which is frustrating, because I have to keep dipping it back in several times to get the tiniest amount out as I'm trying to do a cut crease & it's frustrating. It also smells really weird and chemically, which I'm not a fan of. Lastly I had a situation where it literally clumped up and like took my makeup off of my eye lid? Im not sure if this was an issue with the eyeshadow palette I was using, or something else, but I was using Jeffree Star Cosmetics Jawbreaker in shade 'Snack' and I've never had any issues with any of his palettes so I doubt it was because of the shade. I've only used it twice , first time it wasn't terrible to use. I think maybe what happened to me with it clumping off is it wasnt dry enough before going in with the shadow. So I wont completely knock it for something that was maybe my fault. But over all I still don't like how thick and tacky it is, and how strong and paint like the smell is & definitely dislike the amount of times I have to reach back into the bottle to get anything to come out.","","2","Invest in something better",""

I have had the concealer for about a year and a half. It is WAY too full coverage, but I have found that a little goes a long way so I only use 1-2 dabs under each eye. It is also too thick for its own good. Due to it's consistency, it emphasizes fine lines underneath my eyes, and I am fairly young! In addition, it creases like CRAZY. I have tried everything. Putting on eye cream every night, using a primer for the under eye area, setting the area, ""baking"", and much more. It is such a disappointment because I really wanted to like it, but unfortunately is really bad. However, I will still use it because it was EXPENSIVE. I would stick to lightweight concealers from the drugstore next time.","","1","Not Great",""

The associate applied this concealer and it looked good, didn't cake, matched my skin and covered enough but wasn't too heavy. Based on this initial response I bought the product. A couple hours later I noticed my under eye area was very dry feeling and upon looking in the mirror saw it was very cracked and creased. I chalked it up to using a different eye cream before she applied this product and tried several times throughout the week to get this product to work for me with the same end results each time. I tried different application methods, from beauty blender to brushes to just using my finger and it was always the same within two hours. If I can find my receipt I will be returning this item.

If you love that product I think you'll also love this concealer because it pairs really seamlessly with it.  I have blue veins that peek through my under eye area.  I want to cover them but I don't want to slather on concealer that will that cake up, crease, and draw attention to the texture of the skin in my under eye area.  I've been on the hunt for a hydrating, non-irritating concealer that won't make my under eyes look worse than if I had not used anything.  I've tried: Urban Decay, Bare Minerals, Becca, ELF, NYX, Maybelline, W3LL People, and Pacifica.  While I had some measure of success with some of those I tried, I just wasn't completely satisfied with the results. Since Cover Girl announced they were going cruelty-free, I decided to take another look at their product line and give this product a try and I'm SO glad that I did.  I don't apply it like lipstick, instead, I run my ring finger on to the concealer stick to warm up the product and pick it up on my finger, and then I dab my finger under my eye.  After I've finished dabbing the product I then lightly blend with my Beauty Blender.  I gives me coverage without looking heavy, it just looks like my skin, and doesn't become a mess by the end of the day.  It pairs well with the CG Smoothers BB cream when I want a no-makeup look day and it pairs well with my foundation too, but if you're going for heavier coverage foundation then this might not be a heavy enough coverage concealer to pair with.","","5","It's 2020 and I'm just discovering this gem!",""

I tried it over, and I had to cake on so much concealer and I was still orange! Not the correction shade for my dark circles, sadly.

Now ordering my 3rd pot. I have a medium, olive skin tone. I've always struggled with combination skin, with plenty of oil in my t-zone. Finding a good concealer had been disappointment after disappointment. Either the color, the texture, consistency, staying power or something was always less than desirable. I'm an IT cosmetics girl for my foundation and setting power, as well as some various other IT products. I was in my local store one day, and a consultant that always can tell when I'm having an internal debate. I have a now 1 year old, and at that time she was only 4-5 months old. Sleep was more difficult to come by. Not to mention the days were insanely busy when I returned to work after maternity leave. I explained to her that I needed a good concealer. One that wasn't too slick, didn't have 100 colors to choose from (options are great, I just get overwhelmed when there's too many). I needed it to last all day, blend easy and bit cake or settle in my creases or in the oil my skin surely would produce every single day. The first time I used this, I was a little skeptical. It was hard and not super malleable. It didn't seem to spread like I hoped and had a gritty texture. I used too much then and found it hard to blend. So I learned and kept trying. I would say it took me about a week to find the best application for me. I lightly swirl my finger a couple of times and begin applying by patting onto my eyelids, under eye, nose (redness), and into any areas that I blemishes or discoloration. It warms in your finger, the trick for me is lightly applying. Rubbing it can pull on the skin. After gently putting it on, I use my fingers to gently pat it in. Then use a damp beauty blender to give it a perfect finish. It does away with any discoloration and makes my complexion look beautiful. The creamy texture also perfectly fills pores and other imperfections you wish to hide. My biggest piece of advice is to remember a little goes a long way. If you use too much of this, it will look cakey, it will settle into fine lines. If it's too heavy it can't work right. That's no fault of the product itself. So while your first few tries may be somewhat frustrating, I promise if you just have a little patience and experiment with your technique and coverage needs, you'll begin to love it. Of course it's not for everyone, but for me it's been exactly what I've needed for many years. I can easily wear it to blend my complexion on days I don't want to wear makeup, too. I think my husband is even a little jealous that he doesn't have this for his under eye circles! Lol.","","5","Hands down my favorite concealer!",""

When I initially purchased it (the light one), I didn't have a suitable brush so I just used my fingers. At first try, it was difficult to pick up product. But a few more swirls softened it up, & no issues thereafter. Then I got an e.l.f. eyeshadow brush, the white handle one, and it works just fine as well (more precise application too lol). The bristles on this brush are fairly stiff, that may have something to do with it? A lot of these reviews are older, it's possible NYX changed the formula. Whatever the case, I love this stuff.

I've bout this product before and liked the coverage but never used it as a eyeshadow primer. With everything going on my budget has been tight so I decided to go back to NYX for the time being.

Eyeshadow Primer - It works awesome! Went on great, helped the shadow stay smooth, and didn't settle in the creases of my lid over time.  My eyeshadow looked fresh after hours.

Concealer- Coverage has always done a great job. I'm a mom with dark circles at times and it definitely brightens my eyes. Again, doesn't settle in the creases of the skin after a few hours.

Overall this product is a great bang for your buck without sacrificing anything.  Won't be buying Tarte Shape Tape again.","","5","Same as Tarte Shape Tape...Yes, I said it",""

It's hard enough to find a foundation for porcelain skin, even harder to find a quality one that actually covers and doesn't oxidize. I was woefully disappointed by Two Faced full coverage foundation in Cloud after it matched me but didn't cover well at all and left my skin feeling wet. As long as you blend well and set, this won't crease, as with most foundations, but heavier applications in places such as under the eyes may crease.
This makeup is definitely heavy in pigmentation, but also in weight and feel. Great for oily/combination skin but dry skin or light makeup users might not enjoy.

Doesn't leave any streaking, lasts FOREVER because it doesn't take much to get that coverage, definitely lives up to all of its claims, there are so many different color options, it's buildable, there are so many great things about this product! I usually use a cheaper foundation if I'm just running a couple quick errands and use this for work, going out, etc. When I use my cheaper foundation.. I use this one for my concealer!
